Drexel's E4 Program: A Different Professional Experience for Engineering Students and Faculty,1993,196,202,Robert G. Quinn,Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering E4 Project Director Drexel University,NA,82,4,"In 1988, Drexel began a project which involves a comprehensive restructuring of the lower division engineering curriculum. The program provides an early introduction to the central body of knowledge forming the fabric of engineering, the unifying rather than parochial aspects of engineering, experimental methods, the computer as a flexible, powerful professional and intellectual tool, the importance of personal communications skills, and the imperative for continuous, vigorous, life-long learning. The subject matter is organized in four major components replacing and/or integrating material in thirty-seven existing courses in the traditional curriculum. The theme of all activities is a central focus on the students as emerging professional engineers and the faculty as their mentors from the very beginning of their education. To date, 500 students and 50 faculty have participated in the project. Preliminary results of evaluations are encouraging. Retention rates and achievement levels are high. Performance tests indicate that most students develop excellent levels of computer and laboratory skills. Their written and oral presentations demonstrate achievement of superior levels of communication skills. Personal interviews and evaluations indicate that student response is quite positive and they place a high value on faculty participation in a team effort. Both faculty and students indicate that this different experience has given them an insight into the importance and scope of the engineering profession and a sense that its practice can be exciting, rewarding and enjoyable.",na,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.1993.tb01074.x,1
Attributes of Engineering Graduates and Their Impact on Curriculum Design,1993,203,211,D. L. Evans***G. C. Beakley***P. E. Crouch***G. T.

The Task Force's charge was to explore changes that would better prepare baccalaureate-level engineers for the practice of their profession in the next decade. The generic data developed in the process used by the Task Force are given here. For example, a set of ten important attributes deemed desirable for newly graduated engineers and produced by education, is presented. Also, the rankings by industry, alumni, students, and faculty, of the relative importance of each of these ten attributes and the performance of new graduates in each, are given. Generic curriculum features necessary for successful generation of these attributes are discussed.

A Survey of Engineering Education Outside the United States: Implications for the Ideal Engineering Program,1993,212,215,Peter Dorato***Chaouki Abdallah,Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering University of New Mexico***Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering University of New Mexico,NA,82,4,"Undergraduate engineering programs in fourteen countries are surveyed to determine the status of engineering education outside the United States and to analyze the implications for the ideal engineering program of the future here in the United States. The items surveyed include the number of years required to obtain an engineering degree, title of the engineering degree, high school preparation for engineering programs, cost of education, completion rates for engineering degrees, entrance requirements, mathematical requirements, and support for laboratory work. The most notable aspects of engineering education outside the United States are: • Stronger high school preparation and requirements in mathematics and science • Longer period of time required for an engineering degree • Advanced level of mathematics required in engineering programs • Low cost of education It appears that in most countries engineering education is more intense and rigorous than in the United States.

"The E4 Introductory Engineering Test, Design and Simulation Laboratory",1993,223,226,Robert G. Quinn,Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering E4 Project Director Drexel University,NA,82,4,"At a time when we can least afford it, mastery of experimentation among practicing engineers is fast becoming a lost art. Within the undergraduate engineering curriculum there has been a continuous decrease in emphasis in the study and practice of experimentation over the past several decades. The Introductory Engineering Test, Design and Simulation Laboratory is an important and unique component of the “Enhanced Educational Experience for Engineers,”—Drexel's E4 program—which attempts to reverse this trend in a substantial way. It is based on three premises: that experimentation is a critical and distinguishing element of the profession; that experimental skills require time to develop; and that entering students are interested in laboratory work. Thus it provides early, continuous and significant laboratory experiences for all students regardless of major throughout the freshman and sophomore years. The nature of the program and facilities are based on a perspective which recognizes the rich diversity of engineering experimentation yet emphasizes its common elements. The laboratory facilities and program can be incorporated in most lower-division programs creating the potential for significant improvements in the upper division. The results of our experience since 1989 indicate that the laboratory provides a rich learning environment in which most students achieve or exceed the educational and performance objectives. Equally important, student response is enthusiastic and they have found the laboratory to be a place for them to have a lot of fun becoming engineers!",na,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.1993.tb01078.x,5

Striving for Balance: A Hundred Years of the American Society for Engineering Education,1993,136,151,Terry S. Reynolds***Bruce E. Seely,Michigan Technological University***Michigan Technological University,NA,82,3,"This paper provides an overview of the history of the American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) from its founding in 1893 to the present. The authors see two major continuities in the organization's hundred year history: the search for methods of improving classroom instruction and the pursuit of national recognition as the spokesman for engineering education. An organization concerned with classroom teaching draws its strength from the ranks of teaching faculty; an organization seeking national visibility must draw its leaders from administrators, especially deans. ASEE's history is viewed as an continuing effort to balance these two broad purposes within a single organization.",na,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.1993.tb00092.x,13
Performance Prediction and Enhancement in an Introductory Physics Course for Engineers,1993,152,156,Edward W. Thomas,"School of Physics Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta",NA,82,3,Performance in an introductory physics course for engineers is examined. Class performance is compared with the results of a diagnostic test taken at the start of a course and with performance in preceding classes. The best predictor of performance is found to be prior achievement; the diagnostic tests of basic skills is a poor predictor. It was demonstrated that repeated execution of a particular physics word problem leads to enhanced success and decreased failure; failure decreases by approximately 50% at each exposure. But the improved success on a particular word problem does not translate to a generally improved performance on all problems of its type. An intervention strategy based on repeated performance of “skills” problems does however translate into improved class performance and results in a 30 % decrease in the number of students who achieve unacceptable grades.,na,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.1993.tb00093.x,14

The faculty member is demonstrated to be in a unique position to influence such students, providing strong counterforces to a confluence of attitudes and pressures experienced during the B.S. experience which effectively create a barrier to full-time engineering graduate study. We analyze this barrier via the method of force field analysis, and demonstrate that effective recruitment into full-time graduate study must be based on a four-fold strategy of education, expectations, improved B.S. experience and better control of the B.S. environment.

This study, based on interviews with professional engineers in supervisory roles, suggests that many basic skills required in the workplace, including the ability to work on a team and to communicate with one's peers and supervisors, are missing or insufficiently developed in recent college graduates. Many employers have programs to overcome these deficiencies, but we should also consider what we as educators can do to better prepare students for their future roles, and what students themselves can do to ease the transition.",na,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.1993.tb00097.x,18
Introducing Breadth and Depth in the Humanities and Social Sciences into an Engineering Student's General Education Curriculum,1993,175,180,Peter Blewett,University of Massachusetts Lowell,NA,82,3,"Engineering curricula can include the breadth and depth in the humanities and social sciences that both ABET and sound educational theory require if the general education program is organized into lower and upper divisions distributed over four years. Then during the last two years, small clusters of upper level courses built around agreed-upon themes and requirements can offer students some elective choice while providing coherence among the courses. Thus an institution can develop an alternative to both restrictive, required CORES and loose area-distribution curricula.

Computer simulations helped students develop a better intuitive understanding of fundamental air quality phenomena. Field trips served to illustrate applications of classroom concepts, and an instructional laboratory was developed to teach students the essential techniques of air quality monitoring. The classroom and laboratory were also used as a supportive environment in which students learned professional skills applicable to graduate studies or professional employment.

The future success of our engineering graduates will increasingly depend on not only solid training in scientific and engineering principles, but also a more rigorous education in interpersonal management skills (IPMS). Co-class instruction of sophomore and senior engineering students provides an efficient educational structure to incorporate IPMS education into an existing engineering curriculum. Co-class instruction provides opportunities for senior students to experience direct subordinate supervisory technical management, develop project management skills, formally evaluate personnel performance and improve faculty/student contact. Younger students gain opportunities to see how their engineering education is applied and gives them an opportunity to network with graduating students. Co-class instruction did not significantly increase instructor workload, but does require that one instructor teach both sophomore and senior classes concurrently.

Personal and Professional Enrichment: Humanities in the Engineering Curriculum,1993,141,146,Valarie Meliotes Arms,Department of Humanities and Communications Drexel University,NA,82,2,"The Drexel E4 approach to engineering education has evolved from emphases on teamwork and course integration to include an emphasis on faculty development through the Personal and Professional Enrichment component. One of the four components of the curriculum which are described elsewhere, the Personal and Professional Enrichment Program, encompasses a short orientation course and the year long Humanities sequence. The orientation course, taught by all the team members, provides a forum for faculty as well as students to discuss personal and educational goals. It also provides faculty with a social arena which has become important in developing and maintaining the strong sense of community the team shares. The faculty have profited from talking about themselves as individuals, as much as the students who have discovered professionals as role models—concerned citizens and parents, and lifelong learners. Students are introduced to engineering as a profession that requires not only technological skills but also an awareness of ethics, of the need for lifelong learning, and of the importance of Humanities. It is important to note that the technical faculty teach the introductory course and thus themselves attest to the value of humanistic concerns throughout the entire program.

Teaching versus Research—Incompatibility or Overemphasis?,1993,22,26,Phillip S. Myers,"Mechanical Engineering, University of Wisconsin-Madison",NA,82,1,"There is a perceived conflict between teaching and research. Is this perceived conflict the result of basic incompatibility between teaching and research or over emphasis on one or the other of the two factors? An analysis of the different audiences to which Professors profess is presented, and it is concluded that the problem is under emphasis on teaching. This under emphasis on teaching results from a lack of commitment of resources to evaluating and rewarding formal classroom teaching, the avoidance of painful decisions, and time pressures. The challenges are to develop and apply an accepted procedure for measuring the quality of teaching, to provide realistic opportunities for continued professional development, and to provide the time required to meet both research and teaching expectations, especially for probationary faculty.

Jenkins,"Department of Civil Engineering, Oregon State University***Department of Mechanical Engineering, South Dakota School of Mines and Technology",NA,82,1,"Knowledge and action rest upon a background of shared expectations. ‘Technology’ refers to a particular background of expectations. Key words are: efficiency, productivity, utility, order, control, and objectivity. If, however, such expectations are carried too far, the behavior of mere functionaries becomes established: one becomes preoccupied with the completion of assignments with no time or inclination for the asking of troublesome questions. This paper examines one of the consequences of such behavior. A model is presented illustrating how organizational systems selectively distort assessments. Within such systems, favorable information is more likely to survive and thus a distorting tendency emerges. Such systemic distortions do not require individual fraud or deceit; the ‘normal’ behaviors of functionaries suffice. We claim that these functionary practices arise from taking the technological expectations too far. Examples are presented. Suggestions on avoiding functionary behavior and systemic distortions are discussed. We suggest that greater emphasis be given to the notion of ‘citizen engineers’.",na,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.1993.tb00071.x,46

In our model, we address concerns of industry and engineering educators about the often narrow technical confines within which engineering design is currently taught. Our two-semester design sequence employs multidisciplinary teams of students working with faculty managers for industrial clients to solve complex, open-ended problems possessing numerous technical and non-technical constraints. After a two year pilot phase, the multidisciplinary senior design (MSD) course sequence is now offered to qualified Colorado School of Mines seniors each academic year and fully meets the senior capstone design requirement in each of the participating academic departments. An on-going formative and summative evaluation process allows us to monitor the perceptions and knowledge levels of our students compared with students completing traditional discipline-specific design courses. Our students, faculty, and clients overwhelmingly agree that multidisciplinary design teams tend to produce better engineering designs because of the broader range of expertise available to the team. MSD students strongly agree that higher order thinking skills such as open-ended problem-solving abilities, engineering analysis, and engineering synthesis are important aspects of the design process. Students also rate the course highly and indicate satisfaction with the course structure and curriculum. In addition, project clients are pleased with the quality of the final designs they receive from our students.

The theoretical foundations of the approach are rooted in the Facet Theory which provides a framework for defining a universe of observations and arrive at an empirical structure for reality based decision making processes. The establishment of a definitional system, by means of a mapping sentence, is devised and a corresponding questionnaire for systematic determination of occupational field demands required from engineering graduates, is designed. The sampling issue of the questionnaire-run is discussed and illustrated through experimental data, representing reality-based situations. The purpose is to arrive eventually, through verified data analysis methods, at a hierarchy of skills and knowledge items, to distinctive occupational field demands, to a professional content portrayal and to a structure of professional field requirements.",na,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.1994.tb01107.x,72
Professional Practice: A Topic for Engineering Research and Instruction,1994,231,236,M. Dayne Aldridge,Auburn University,NA,83,3,"Professional practice is considered as a much broader topic for inclusion in engineering curricula than traditionally associated with engineering design. Practicing engineers require a working knowledge of several non-engineering disciplines and must interact with people of a variety of backgrounds within a variety of organizational contexts. Engineers must develop the skills of problem solving and decision making for circumstances much broader than generally used in the engineering class room. Professional engineering practice in this broad context can be the subject of legitimate research and instruction. Case research methods are applicable to the exploratory study of engineering practice and the development of a knowledge base important to designing engineering curricula. Case instruction provides one method of dealing with topics at the boundaries of the engineering disciplines and in developing decision making skills that are fundamental to engineering practice. It is concluded that the engineering education community should explore new frameworks for research, instruction and the associated scholarship that address professional practice issues.",na,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.1994.tb01108.x,73
Project Preserve: A Program to Retain Minorities in Engineering,1994,237,242,Carole Morning***Jacqueline Fleming,Higher Education Extension Service***Barnard College Motivation Research Corporation,NA,83,3,"A national effort, begun in 1972 to increase the numbers of minorities in engineering, has made substantial progress, but the attrition for minority students is still estimated at 70%. To address the problem, Project Preserve was designed to confirm, by demonstration, the results of previous research showing that the combination of explicit cognitive development, close relationships with faculty, and strong bonds to an institution can raise the performance and retention of minority engineering students. The project enrolled over 100 minority engineering students who had been dismissed from freshman engineering studies on other campuses or placed on academic probation, but whose high school grades and SAT scores were indicative of success. They were channeled into participating institutions chosen for their record of basic support services, willingness to augment or restructure those services, and for variation among institutional variables: Xavier University of Louisiana (XU), California State University at Northridge (CSUN), and City College of the City University of New York (CCNY). A 2 1/2 hour battery of evaluation instruments was given to 79 students upon entry and to 26 students upon their attaining Junior status after two years in the program. The results demonstrated that: (1) an admirable 64% of would-be drop outs had achieved Junior status or were still enrolled in engineering at the conclusion of two years; (2) cognitive growth occurred on basic memory skills and one critical thinking skill, but there were institutional differences in the extent of intellectual development, with Xavier producing the most change; (3) closer relationships to faculty were outcomes; (4) the most positive feelings about, or bonding to, the institution occurred at Xavier University, while the most evidence of social participation and connectedness occurred at CSUN.",na,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.1994.tb01109.x,74

Mastery Quizzes as a Teaching Tool in the Mechanics Series,1994,255,258,R.L. Ward,Department of Civil Engineering Ohio Northern University,NA,83,3,"Ohio Northern University (ONU) is a 2800 student, United Methodist Church related, undergraduate institution. In the Fall quarter of the 1988-89 academic year, the Engineering College began using mastery quizzes in the “Mechanics Series” courses of Statics, Dynamics, and Mechanics of Materials 1. These three courses are typically taken during the sophomore year. Mastery quizzes are used as a reinforcing tool. Three or four areas in each of these mechanics courses were identified as critical to the success of a student in future courses. A set of mastery quizzes has been made for each of these critical areas. A student must complete one of the quizzes in each set with a perfect score to pass the course. The first quiz in each critical area is taken in class for a score, and if not completed perfectly, must be retaken outside class on a pass-fail basis. This analysis looked at the percent answered correctly by Ohio Northern students in the specific areas of statics, dynamics, and mechanics of materials on the Fundamentals Exam (F.E.) to determine whether the use of mastery quizzes improved scores in these three areas. Statistical analysis (Analysis of Variance-ANOVA) was performed on the two sets of data. The three years from 1988-90 were used to represent the F.E. pass rates without the use of mastery quizzes and 1991-93 were used to represent the scores with the use of mastery quizzes. Mixed results were obtained from this analysis. It indicated that mastery quizzes improved the scores in the dynamics and mechanics areas, which seem to be the most difficult courses of the three for ONU students. There seems to be no improvement in the statics area. It is felt that the reinforcing of concepts and problem solving by the repetitive taking of mastery quizzes is a help in the more difficult courses such as Dynamics and Mechanics of Materials.",na,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.1994.tb01112.x,77

Lindauer,Department of Mechanical Engineering University of Louisville***Department of Mechanical Engineering University of Louisville,NA,83,3,"Instructional modules for introductory thermodynamics which are multifaceted and sufficiently flexible to adapt to the various learning styles of most engineering students are currently being developed at the University of Louisville. Flexibility is incorporated through the utilization of computer controlled interactive multimedia displays, which include full motion graphical images and sound. This technology makes it possible for the instructor to present information in a manner that is faster, more visually appealing, more organized, more detailed, and more open to student interaction than the student lecture format. The instructional modules under development will allow the instructor to implement several different types of classroom activity during a single class period. These include audio-visual presentations, problem solving sessions, and question and answer sessions using electronic acquisition of the student responses, as well as the usual lecture type of presentation. Parts of the module are available outside of the classroom as computer based tutorials. The module chosen for initial development was the “First Law of Thermodynamics for a Closed System.” The first version of this module has been completed and given preliminary trials in the classroom. This module includes optional material on the historical development of the first law of thermodynamics, and also a variety of optional problems, exercises, and short quizzes.

Ernst Eder,"Department of Mechanical Engineering, Royal Military College of Canada",NA,83,2,"If various learning theories and psychological typing are to apply, they should relate to each other in some explainable way. Some of these relationships seem to be hierarchical and show parallels with two other phenomena: product development and design, and progress in science. Product development is a function which initiates engineering design and carries the early life of a product. Piaget's model of early learning shows some similarities. During designing, the needs, requirements and constraints for a potential solution are progressively transformed into a description of a system that can be manufactured and implemented. Proposals for alternative solutions can be generated at abstraction levels used in designing, selecting the most promising. This seems to have some parallels to Perry's learning model. Similar events occur in the crisis points in developments of science. During designing, a cycle of basic activities known as problem-solving takes place. This cycle shows useful analogies to Kolb's model of learning. Some consequences for engineering education are indicated.",na,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.1994.tb01088.x,87

The faculty have profited from talking about themselves as individuals, as much as the students who have discovered professionals as role models—concerned citizens and parents, and lifelong learners. Students are introduced to engineering as a profession that requires not only technological skills but also an awareness of ethics, of the need for lifelong learning, and of the importance of Humanities. It is important to note that the technical faculty teach the introductory course and thus themselves attest to the value of humanistic concerns throughout the entire program. Continuing the integration of goals as well as subjects, the Humanities curriculum includes the traditional sequence in reading, writing, and research skills with an emphasis on technical writing, visuals and oral presentation skills. Meritorious texts are chosen to highlight humanistic concerns about the impact of technology so that students recognize the engineers' obligation to the world we all share.

The class of 65 students was divided into 13 groups of five students each. With some guidance, each group chose an engineer who made a significant contribution to modern structural engineering theory and/or practice. Each group was required to research the life and work of the chosen engineer and present an oral, in-class demonstration, experiment, or other visual illustration of a theoretical or applied concept that characterized a major contribution of the selected individual. In addition, each student was required to submit an independently written paper addressing one of a set of standard questions posed to all groups. The project encouraged the students to discover the unique engineering skills demonstrated by some of the great engineers who made important contributions to modern structural engineering practice.

Interdisciplinary Centers: A Natural and Necessary Force for Creativity and Change in Engineering Research and Education,1994,29,32,Richard E. Schuler,Cornell University,NA,83,1,"Because problem-solving is the distinguishing feature of engineering education and innovation, interdisciplinary approaches are essential since technologically-related problems do not align themselves neatly in accordance with traditional academic disciplines or professional societies. The challenge is to sustain the evolution of institutional and academic structures to keep pace with rapid advances in technology and social concerns. The tension is between quality control as administered by traditional institutional structure and emerging societal needs and technological opportunities like the environment. Interdisciplinary centers with budget autonomy, in conjunction with re-aligned engineering “departments and professional designations”, can be important vehicles for change. The ultimate measure of success of these proposed structures is that change will be institutionalized, and engineering education will constantly evolve to meet society's emerging needs. Reading through the directories of most major universities (admittedly, no substitute for serious academic research), I am struck by the burgeoning list of acronyms representing administrative units of interdisciplinary centers. As an example, at Cornell there are over 50 interdisciplinary programs and centers. They have become nearly as numerous as the traditional academic departments.",na,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.1994.tb00113.x,111

Hierarchical competencies are given to distinguish all college graduates, all engineering graduates, and all biological engineering graduates. Basic engineering concepts and basic biology concepts are sometimes conflicting, but must nevertheless be incorporated in undergraduate courses. Specific required courses will vary from university to university, but all biological engineering curriculums must include courses on engineering topics, life sciences topics, and courses that integrate the two.

Measuring the Retention Strategies of a Minority Engineering Program: A Service Quality Perspective,1995,395,400,Douglas Hermond,University of Houston,NA,84,4,Minority Engineering Programs (MEPs) use several strategies designed to retain underrepresented minorities in engineering disciplines. It is necessary to evaluate MEPs to determine which strategies contribute to the effective recruitment and retention of minorities in engineering disciplines. One method of measuring program effectiveness is to solicit the opinion of minority students about program effectiveness since they use the MEP services. This article discusses the development and administration of an instrument to assess the quality of service minority engineering freshmen received from an MEP. The results indicate that students were generally satisfied with the quality of service they received from the seven retention strategies the institution employed.

Integrating Design Across the Engineering Curriculum: A Report From the Trenches,1995,235,240,V. Wilczynski***S. M. Douglas,United States Coast Guard Academy***United States Coast Guard Academy,NA,84,3,"The emphasis from ABET to integrate the design experience across the curriculum has initiated a call for action to engineering departments across the country. This challenges engineering educators to include design in a wide variety of engineering courses and to prevent this emphasis from foreshadowing the subject material of each course. A comprehensive approach is needed where the design work is not a separate entity, but rather is an additional tool which can be used to teach the fundamentals of engineering. This paper reports on the advances of one institution in responding to the call to integrate design across the engineering curriculum. The U.S. Coast Guard Academy (USCGA) has established a design philosophy that treats design education as a developmental process to be practiced during each of the four undergraduate years. To put that philosophy into practice, the USCGA has restructured the engineering curriculum to ensure that students experience design content in their courses each year. This viewpoint of design as a developmental process is consistent with the broad educational objectives of the institution. This paper presents examples of design work from courses in each year of the students' education to illustrate the variety of design problems used to incorporate design across the curriculum.

Practitioner and Student Recommendations for an Engineering Curriculum,1995,241,248,Enno Koehn,"Department of Civil Engineering Lamar University, Beaumont, Texas",NA,84,3,"For over 100 years studies have consistently recommended that the engineering curriculum should stress underlying principles and have a considerable range of cultural studies. Nevertheless, some employers continue to state that they are not totally satisfied with the average engineering graduate. The findings of this study, however, suggest that practicing engineers and students are generally satisfied with the civil engineering curriculum. Nevertheless, both groups recommend that the credits allocated to surveying, graphics, and computers should be increased. Practitioners, in general, believe that there should be a decrease in mathematically oriented subjects such as calculus, statistics and numerical methods. Older graduates, in particular, recommend an increase in business courses such as law, accounting, and personnel management. They also believe that technical writing and oral communication skills should be a vital part of the program. It appears to be difficult to design a curriculum, requiring a reasonable number of credits, that satisfies all age groups.

The method is based on asking a multiple choice question after every 10 to 20 minutes of a lecture and getting responses from all the students. The students respond by raising a card which displays the letter corresponding to their choice of answer. The method is easy to implement in any traditional lecture setting. It provides instant assessment of student learning and lets an instructor take corrective measure, if necessary, in the same class period. The method allows all the students in a class to actively participate, evaluate their own performance, and reflect upon what they have learned.

Data from 1990–1993 fall freshmen classes and 1991–1994 spring senior classes have been evaluated, where the 1994 seniors are the first group for which freshmen data are available. s drawn from the results are: 1) Overall, there has been a shift from “plug-and-chug” quadrant B thinking to increased “creative” quadrant D thinking, because more students with strong quadrant D preferences are being developed and retained, primarily due to the new creative problem solving course. 2) Avoidance of quadrant C thinking (teamwork skills) is persisting and creates classroom climates that are uncomfortable for some students, a high percentage being females. Students are not developing the teamwork and interpersonal thinking skills demanded by industry. 3) A majority of students are still being cloned in the A-dominant profile of the faculty. Students who have developed independent ways of practicing right-brain thinking and all students who were involved in creative problem solving as class assistants became more whole-brained or right-brained.

Rarely has a management philosophy so entirely captured the imagination of corporate leaders and workers alike. Throughout the nation, programs such as Total Quality Management (TQM) have transformed the ways manufacturing companies and service providers operate. The Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award, given annually to the best companies in a number of categories, illustrates the importance of this movement at the highest government levels. The modern quality movement began in post World War II Japan based on principles developed by W. Edwards Deming an American consultant. Only in recent years has American industry, recognizing the necessity of improved quality for international competitiveness, adopted Deming's principles with enthusiasm. Reference 1 provides an enumeration and discussion of the principles. University administrators are beginning to recognize that TQM may have a place in academia as illustrated in reference 2. Pressed by industry requirements for persons trained in quality improvement, faculty in business and engineering schools have begun to teach quality concepts and are considering using quality techniques in the design of curricula. References 3 and 4 describe industry/university cooperation in this area. Less often individual courses are designed and operated using quality principles as illustrated in reference 5 and a number of papers at recent ASEE Conferences.

There were sex differences favouring males, similar to those seen in other academic programs. There were no significant sex differences in academic course performance, suggesting that differences in spatial ability as measured by the MRT do not have an impact on course performance. In addition, minimal experience with the mental rotation task produced large gains in performance and reduced the magnitude of sex differences. The results suggest that sweeping statements about the relation between differences in spatial ability and performance in science and mathematics subject areas, especially with reference to females, must be viewed with caution.",na,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.1995.tb00148.x,175
Project-Based Civil Engineering Courses,1995,75,79,M. Mahendran,School of Civil Engineering Queensland University of Technology,NA,84,1,"Problem solving is an essential element of civil engineering education. It has been observed that students are best able to understand civil engineering theory when there is a practical application of it. Teaching theory alone has led to lower levels of comprehension and motivation and a correspondingly higher rate of failure and “drop-out”. This paper analyses the effectiveness of introducing practical design projects at an early stage within a civil engineering undergraduate program at Queensland University of Technology. In two of the essential basic subjects, Engineering Mechanics and Steel Structures, model projects which simulate realistic engineering exercises were introduced. Students were required to work in small groups to analyse, design and build the lightest / most efficient model bridges made of specific materials such as spaghetti, drinking straw, paddle pop sticks and balsa wood and steel columns for a given design loading/target capacity. The paper traces the success of the teaching strategy at each stage from its introduction through to the final student and staff evaluation.",na,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.1995.tb00149.x,176

Atman***Indira Nair,Department of Industrial Engineering University of Pittsburgh***Department of Engineering and Public Policy Carnegie Mellon University,NA,85,4,"Calls for curricular reform in engineering include teaching engineering principles in the broader context of society. In this paper, we empirically investigate how freshmen students perceive the broader societal context of science and technology. We explored the questions: • What is the framework of knowledge and attitudes of engineering freshmen on science, technology and society (STS) issues? • How different are their frameworks from those of students in other majors? • We used a structured, open-ended interview methodology to elicit knowledge about two STS issues: “human energy needs” and “global climate change.” Our sample consists of ninety-two students. Each student was interviewed about one topic. First, we found that there was no difference in the attitude expressed about technology by engineering students and students who are not engineering majors. Both groups think science and technology solve problems more often than they create problems. Second, we found that, although the difference is not large, engineering students consistently mentioned more concepts than students with other majors, and they mentioned these concepts more often. Qualitatively, the specific concepts mentioned by the two groups were almost identical for both topics. The engineering students mentioned more technological concepts and students in other majors mentioned more societal concepts for the human energy needs topic. In summary, the knowledge and perceptions of STS issues of freshmen engineering students and students who are not engineering majors are largely similar. This suggests that common, interdisciplinary STS courses are a good approach for providing general technological literacy for both groups.",na,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.1996.tb00251.x,188

This ethnographic study of the discourse used by professors and students during a sophomore design class demonstrates that some women's difficulties are the result of cultural features of engineering that are only rarely open to redefinition by women. In spite of many engineering educators' sincere commitments to improving women's experiences in engineering education, these cultural features diminish the successes of reform-minded engineering education. I detail how discourse in whole-class and teamwork settings indicated the cultural norms of engineering talk and how this discourse reinforced traditional practices that were only rarely open to revision. Also, I comment on the use of ordeals in this classroom. My findings suggest that engineering education must change before inclusion of women is realized. In particular, I suggest the changes needed are complex and include 1) more communication about the ways that cultural norms impact women and other marginalized groups, 2) forums where participants can speak openly without fear of retaliation, and 3) attention to changing those policies and practices that send narrow messages about who engineers are and what engineering might be.",na,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.1996.tb00236.x,202

Specific plans for curriculum revision included a) early exposure to design and the product realization process, including issues such as marketing, manufacturing and economics, as well as concept generation, evaluation and documentation; b) integration of design and open-ended problem solving experiences across the curriculum, including the core engineering sciences courses; c) development of the softer skills associated with communication and teamwork; and d) greater emphasis on engineering practice through increased linkages with industry.

Experimental Curriculum in Diagnostics and Control of Unsteady Flows,1996,263,268,Narayananm. Komerath,School of Aerospace Engineering Georgia Institute of Technology,NA,85,3,"To be a successful experimenter, the engineer must continually learn and integrate concepts and skills from various disciplines. Unconventional techniques are needed to overcome traditional obstacles and integrate such experimental learning into the crowded undergraduate curriculum, and to tie the curriculum to the leading edge of technology. This paper describes the experiments and learning methods of a Flow Imaging and Control Laboratory and the integration of its products into the fluid dynamics curriculum. Obstacles to laboratory development were circumvented by empowering students and applying an iterative approach both to the development of the program and to the methods of learning. New courses in diagnostics and control of fluid dynamics were developed and tested. A visual database has been established as a vehicle to continually integrate research advances into the curriculum. A mechanism for self-sustainment and evolution of the curriculum has been devised. Learning fluid dynamics is improved by providing visual access to the dynamics of fluids, enhancing hands-on participation, integrating flow control problems, and enabling resonance between research and undergraduate education.",na,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.1996.tb00242.x,208

Engineering Ethics: What? Why? How? And When?,1996,93,96,Charles Edwin Harris***Michael Davis***Michael S. Pritchard***Michael J. Rabins,Department of Philosophy Texas A&M University***Center for the Study of Ethics in the Professions Illinois Institute of Technology***Department of Philosophy Western Michigan University***Department of Mechanical Engineering Texas A & M University,NA,85,2,"Engineering ethics is professional ethics, as opposed to personal morality. It sets the standards for professional practice, and is only learned in a professional school or in professional practice. It is an essential part of professional education because it helps students deal with issues they will face in professional practice. The best way to teach engineering ethics is by using cases—not just the disaster cases that make the news, but the kinds of cases that an engineer is more likely to encounter. Many cases are available, and there are methods for analyzing them. Engineering ethics can be taught in a free-standing course, but there are strong arguments for introducing ethics in technical courses as well. Engineering is something that engineers do, and what they do has profound effects on others. If the subject of professional ethics is how members of a profession should, or should not, affect others in the course of practicing their profession, then engineering ethics is an essential aspect of engineering itself and education in professional responsibilities should be part of professional education in engineering, just as it is in law and medicine. Probably few engineering educators would disagree with these claims; their implementation in engineering education is another matter. We want to discuss the introduction of engineering ethics into engineering education in terms of four questions: What is engineering ethics? Why should it be emphasized in engineering education? How should it be taught? and When should it appear in the student's education?",na,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.1996.tb00216.x,212
Defining “Engineer:” How To Do It and Why It Matters,1996,97,101,Michael Davis,Center for the Study of Ethics in the Professions Illinois Institute of Technology,NA,85,2,"Controversy concerning whether “software engineers” are, or should be, engineers provides an opportunity to think about how to define “engineer” and what effect different definitions may have on our understanding of engineering. The standard definitions of engineering are shown to generate more confusion than insight. Engineering should be defined historically, as an occupation, and ethically, as a profession. An engineer is a member of the engineering profession, that is, a member both of an occupation that is engineering by “birth,” “adoption,” or “marriage” and of the profession committed to engineering's code of ethics. Today, few “software engineers” satisfy either of these conditions. It is an open question whether they should.",na,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.1996.tb00217.x,213

This essay frames the current debate by seeing change as motivated by external competitive and technological forces. Resistance to change is viewed as being reinforced by the fundamental myth of engineering education that asserts the supremacy of basic research over all other engineering academic activities. After providing evidence that the myth resulted largely from an overestimation of the role of science and an underestimation of the role of engineering in World War II, the essay considers needed organizational, integrative, and programmatic changes. Among these are the creation of student-faculty teams responsible for delivering a quality education, bottom-up alliances with industrial clients, and a number of proposals aimed at helping the profession explore its human, philosophical, and historical underpinnings. The essay concludes by warning that times of great change risk making matters worse through the unintended consequences of reform. A principled methodology of reform is suggested that advocates distributed and competitive implementation together with a special appreciation for knowledge that is difficult to articulate.",na,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.1996.tb00219.x,215

The design class improved some women students' experiences, but these opportunities did not exist for all women in the class or in all settings on the campus.

By adopting a customer focus and establishing a dialogue with the students in the course, it became clear that lectures, handouts, and homework assignments could be more effective.

For this assignment, students choose an artifact, research it, create a one-page annotated visual explaining how it works, and then write an original poem about it. Although the poetry instruction, based on a transactional model, takes place in the Humanities classroom, student poems become a component of a concurrent engineering assignment and are read aloud in an engineering lecture, attended by humanities faculty, designated as the “Poetry Reading.” Short in length and having a distinct design on the page, poetry is a particularly suitable literary medium for engineering students to explore.

Dembe,Occupational Health Program University of Massachusetts Medical Center,NA,85,2,"Despite calls for the integration of safety into engineering curricula and the establishment of ABET requirements for safety-related instruction, few engineering colleges have instituted formal course offerings focusing on safety and health. Impediments include the lack of room for additional coursework in the standard curriculum, the perceived unavailability of qualified faculty and instructional materials, and a widespread conviction among faculty and administrators that safety is not critical to an engineering education. Attempts to address this need by developing special instructional safety modules or enrolling students in full-semester safety courses have met with limited success. An alternative approach is to use safety-related examples and case studies to portray conventional engineering principles. Rather than separating safety instruction into a distinct course or modules, this approach would present safety principles as a fully-integrated part of traditional engineering practice. To make this idea a reality, appropriate examples and cases will need to be developed and disseminated.

However, a recent survey of United States engineering deans indicates in the next three years over 100 engineering programs may require student computer ownership in some form. Most faculty and administrators recognize that student computer ownership is simply the next step in the continuum of calculational power in engineering curricula having evolved from simple pencil and paper, then to slide rule, hand held calculators, and now computers. Everyone agrees that those who hire our graduates expect them to be fully comfortable and competent with the enhanced computational capabilities, modeling, simulation, word processing, spread sheeting, and other hardware and software tools available. However, the more exciting reason for ownership, and one that holds the greatest promise of drastically changing the teaching/learning enterprise, is that proper application of information technologies will permit us to change how students learn and to improve how faculty and student time is utilized.",na,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.1997.tb00301.x,242

"Assigning Functional Groups: The Influence of Group Size, Academic Record, Practical Experience, and Learning Style",1997,321,332,David Hunkeler***Julie E. Sharp,Department of Chemistry Swiss Federal Institute of Technology***Department of Chemical Engineering Vanderbilt University,NA,86,4,"This paper summarizes the results of a four-year study (September 1992 - December 1995) concerned with the performance of student groups in a senior engineering laboratory course. The investigation was conducted in two stages. In the first two years, the effect of group size, incoming GPA, practical experience, and the gender distribution of each group was investigated. During this period we recorded the Kolb Learning Style Inventory (LSI) scores at the end of the semester and asked students to report on the performance of their groups given their knowledge of the LSI distribution within their team. In the second stage of this study (1994–95) we evaluated the effect of grouping according to LSI, in addition to continuing our study of the effect of group size, academic record, practical experience, and gender distribution. In the final year of the study we took advantage of the disparity in the incoming GPAs of the two sections of the class (Tuesday and Thursday) to evaluate if incoming GPA influenced course grade. The study consisted of four senior classes totaling 110 students in 33 groups. The learning styles distribution of the students resulted in 6% “Type 1,” 42% “Type 2,” 42% “Type 3,” and 10% “Type 4” learners. The metric used to quantify performance was the average final course grade of students within given groups. This course grade was equally weighted between technical and writing components. Our results indicate that the most important positive correlating factor in a group's performance was the group size (four member groups statistically outperformed three member teams at α = 0.05). Although not statistically significant, observable higher average group grades indicated that the following may have an effect on group performance: the inclusion of academically outstanding individuals, the number of members with “good hands,” and the GPA history of the group. Specifically, the inclusion of a student with a GPA above 3.6 improved the performance (average group grade) of the group relative to their abilities as characterized by their average incoming GPA. Students who were good with equipment or had some practical hands-on experience had a similar positive influence on the group performance. The gender distribution within a group did not have a significant effect on either group performance or dysfunction. Insufficient data were collected to ascertain the relative performance of homogeneous and mixed learning style groups. Since group incoming GPA may be a variable in group performance, student self-selection is not recommended since it would result in an amplified disparity in the course grades. Indeed, we observed that grouping students by GPA, group size, and LSI resulted in a large number of functional teams, with the final variance in the course grade within a class reduced relative to other courses which have grouped activities.",na,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.1997.tb00305.x,246

Many universities encounter couples who are seeking two tenure-track faculty positions, and the success of many academic searches hinges on finding suitable employment for each member of a dual career team. Couples in these situations are often unsure of the most effective strategy for finding two suitable academic positions and often rely on anecdotal information when searching for professorial positions. With these shortcomings in mind, we designed a survey to determine the common attributes of successful dual career searches where both members of the dual career team successfully found tenure-track positions in engineering.

Some have proposed that improving the relevance of engineering education can have a marked influence on the future success of U.S. manufacturing. Some in academia have heard industries' cries for help to improve relevancy in engineering education and have responded with various solutions. Is this the situation in Japan? What is the state of engineering education in Japan? Where is it headed and how does the U.S. compare? We found that industry-academia relationships like those being strengthened in the U.S. are minimal in Japan. Surprisingly, Japanese industry and academia appear not to be headed in a collaborative direction and are even more detached from one another than in the United States.

Wallace***Philip Mutooni,Department of Mechanical Engineering Massachusetts Institute of Technology***Technology and Policy Program Massachusetts Institute of Technology,NA,86,3,"This paper investigates the hypothesis that the World Wide Web (WWW) presents a new opportunity to interactively present and disseminate curricula. The WWW appears to have the flexibility needed to let students order the material and choose the presentation format that best suit their preference. The objective of this paper is twofold: to develop a general web-lecture structure that provides such flexibility, and to compare its efficacy with a classroom style lecture. The average grade performance of the students receiving web instruction was higher than for those receiving traditional classroom instruction. An achieved significance level of 0.063 provides reasonably strong evidence to reject the hypothesis that the two groups performed equally. Analysis of web-lecture use patterns revealed that the web-group students spent roughly the same amount of time on-line as the classroom group spent in lecture. However, the web group typically covered the materials in three short 30 minute sessions as opposed to one 90 minute lecture. Different students in the web group showed different preferences for either video or text-with-image presentation of materials. In a focus group, web students indicated that they valued the ability to pace their learning and review materials as needed. The positive results of this preliminary study raise the question of how teaching could change to exploit information technology and provide more effective and economical engineering education. Primary learning might take place individually through a medium such as the WWW, thus liberating classroom time for experiential activities.",na,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.1997.tb00287.x,256

The presentation begins with the students building a six feet long, structurally sound bridge which they can crawl across. A pictorial presentation helps them learn to identify some of the different types of bridges: truss, stone arch, steel arch, concrete girder, cable-stayed, and suspension. They are introduced to the fundamental engineering concepts of tension and compression. These concepts are reinforced by demonstrating that if a tension member is replaced with a chain then the bridge is still strong, but if a compression member is replaced with a chain the bridge will collapse. The presentation was integrated into the engineering curriculum by having senior design groups develop new bridge concepts and introduce new ideas into the presentation.

Integrating Design into the Sophomore and Junior Level Mechanics Courses,1997,227,231,Douglas R. Carroll,Department of Basic Engineering University of Missouri - Rolla,NA,86,3,"Engineering schools across the country are developing ways of integrating design into their curriculum, and a question that often arises is how to best integrate design into the sophomore and junior level courses. Freshman design projects or mechanical dissection courses are designed to give the students hands-on experience in conceptual design and construction, with little if any of the mathematical modeling normally used in engineering design. The capstone senior design project is a true engineering design experience, where students draw from their background to conceptualize, analyze, model, refine, and optimize a product to meet design, manufacturing, and life cycle cost requirements. The sophomore and junior level courses should assist students in making the transition from the “seat-of-the-pants” freshman design approach to the engineering design approach required for the capstone experience and engineering practice.

These courses are an integral part of a new curriculum option in Product Realization. The courses were developed by a unique team approach and their materials are available electronically over the World Wide Web. Industry partners provide real-world problems and are the customers for students in our senior capstone design courses. As of December 1996, over 200 interdisciplinary projects have been completed across the three schools. These projects involve teams of students from Industrial, Mechanical, Electrical, Chemical Engineering and Business. Forty-three faculty members, across five time zones, are engaged in this effort.",na,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.1997.tb00272.x,272

The Creative Experience in Engineering Practice: Implications for Engineering Education,1997,133,138,P. Gary Klukken***J. Roger Parsons***Peter J. Columbus,Student Counseling Services Center The University of Tennessee at Knoxville***Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering The University of Tennessee at Knoxville***Department of Psychology The University of Tennessee at Knoxville,NA,86,2,"This research came about as an outgrowth of mounting concern among industrial leaders about the impact of traditional engineering education on the creative potential of future engineers. As there is little agreement on creativity or how to teach it, we chose to begin the study without assuming a theoretical stance about engineering creativity. Instead, we started with a search for first-hand information about creativity and the creative process experienced by working engineers. This phenomenological research paradigm is a way to describe a complex, dynamic experience without prior assumptions, the results of which can then be used to generate theory or develop a structure directly from the data. This approach has similarities to an expert system development, in which the knowledge and skills of an expert are gathered and processed to develop an understanding of the system or phenomenon. Eight professional engineers from the southeastern United States were selected by peer nomination as examples of (expert) creative engineers. They were trained in different areas of engineering (eg. chemical, mechanical, industrial) and worked in organizations ranging from large international consulting firms to small regional businesses. These subjects were interviewed about their experiences in doing creative work and their thoughts about the creative process, including the impact of relevant educational experiences. These interviews were audio-recorded and subjected to a phenomenological data analytic procedure, which extracted the experiential themes and educational issues. The experiential themes involved in the creative process of working engineers clustered as • Desire and fulfillment (motivation), • Autonomy and support (environment), • Openness and knowledge (tools), and • Engrossment and connection (process). This paper discusses the implications and application of these themes for curricular innovation in engineering education.",na,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.1997.tb00276.x,276
Characteristics of Freshman Engineering Students: Models for Determining Student Attrition in Engineering,1997,139,149,Mary Besterfield-Sacre***Cynthia J. Atman***Larry J. Shuman,"Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering University of Texas, El Paso***Department of Industrial Engineering University of Pittsburgh***University of Pittsburgh",NA,86,2,"Nationwide, less than half the freshman who start in engineering graduate in engineering, and at least half of this attrition occurs during the freshman year. Clearly, the freshman year is critical for both academic success and retention of engineering students. Such success depends not only on the knowledge and skills learned during this first year, but also on the attitudes individual students bring with them to college. Hence, if these attitudes can be measured before beginning college, we can develop more targeted programs for reducing attrition and improving academic success. Further, by measuring changes in student attitude over the course of the freshman year, we can develop better methods to evaluate engineering education programs. To learn more about these attitudes and how they impact upon retention, we undertook a three-year research effort. First we identified attitudes incoming students have about the field of engineering, their perceptions about the upcoming educational experience, and their confidence in their ability to succeed in engineering. These attitudes were then related to performance and retention in the freshman engineering program. To accomplish this, a closedform survey was developed, tested and administered to the 1993–94 and 1994–95 freshman engineering classes. This study demonstrated that student attitudes can provide an effective means for evaluating aspects of our freshman engineering program, particularly those relating to issues of attrition. Specifically, students who left the freshman engineering program in “good academic standing” had significantly different attitudes about engineering and themselves than those possessed by other comparison groups: students who stayed in engineering and students who left engineering in “poor academic standing.” We developed regression models to predict attrition and performance in our freshman engineering program using quantified measures of student attitudes. Implementation of the models has allowed freshman advisors to better inform students of opportunities that engineering offers, to devise better programs of study that take advantage of students' varied interests, and to set retention goals that are more realistic.",na,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.1997.tb00277.x,277

We studied 153 students in an introductory engineering course. Overall, students made significant progress in spatial reasoning. In addition, gender differences in the ability to generate orthographic projections on the pre-test disappeared on the post-test. Spatial reasoning ability was a significant predictor of overall course grade, and strong spatial skills were necessary for success on the course exams. Spatial strategy instruction helps students build a repertoire of approaches for engineering problem solving and contributes to confidence in engineering, especially for women. We recommend starting instruction on spatial strategies used by practicing engineers in introductory engineering courses and building on these skills throughout the curriculum.",na,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.1997.tb00278.x,278

Student, faculty, and staff response to the class was very positive, partly due to the popularity of hands-on engineering and partly because LEGO® blocks allow the students to exercise their creativity and innovation. The strength in the LDAPS methodology lies in the power of the LEGO® bricks and the LabVIEWTM software. LEGO® motors, sensors, and bricks are almost infinitely configurable, making each experiment unique.

The first level core courses serve as the entry points into the graduate program. More focused courses are offered at the second and third levels. Students in the EPAR program are generally required to take half of the academic credits from these courses and the other half as traditional engineering core courses in mechanics, vibrations, reliability, thermal engineering, and computer aided design. In order to respond effectively to the evolving nature of the field, the EPAR courses are kept current by strong industrial participation. Many of the specialized graduate courses include guest lectures by industrial experts.

Historically, engineering enrollment has focused on new student recruitment, but recently much more attention has been directed toward the issue of student retention. Our efforts at Iowa State University to examine retention issues were divided into two parts. Phase I of the study, which is presented in this paper, was targeted to accomplish several objectives. First, we had to design and assemble a data base that would allow for individual tracking of students. Once a complete profile of our students population had been assembled, it was possible to identify accurately a range of descriptive variables. Next, using the established data base we developed a retention analysis tool that would statistically suggest and identify students who are potentially at risk of attrition. To do this we examined a range of independent variables against a set of dependent risk categories. Statistical analyses and logistic regression methods were performed to provide a predictive model. Phase II of this study is currently in process and involves a multitude of attrition variables which were not considered, quantified, or integrated into Phase I. When factors such as background, social integration, attitude, etc. can be successfully measured and integrated into the data base the accuracy of our current model is expected to improve.",na,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.1997.tb00259.x,286

An external evaluation was conducted to determine the efficacy of the telecourse, which was broadcast by the CWE to SUNY Farmingdale for twelve Long Island defense manufacturers as well as to eleven other locations for forty-four additional companies throughout the State. A total of one hundred eighty-nine manufacturing employees from fifty-six different companies attended the telecourse. Data clearly supported the efficacy of the ISO 9000 telecourse in providing participants with the means to begin to integrate ISO standards with their current quality standards. A one year follow-up study indicated participants had made progress toward achieving ISO or related certifications and further confirmed that CWE had positively impacted their journey toward certification and profitability.",na,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.1998.tb00391.x,301

In situ remediation of subsurface pollution is a challenging scientific and engineering problem that is well suited to multidisciplinary problem-solving approaches. Quantitative design guidance, appropriate textbook instruction, and hands-on experimental activities are not currently available at most academic institutions. We developed and implemented a set of two courses, one stressing fundamentals in conjunction with design issues, and the other focussing on engineering design aspects of several innovative subsurface remediation technologies. Course materials were derived from our combined multidisciplinary research experiences, coupling physical, chemical, geological, and biological approaches to remediate subsurface pollution. We equipped a laboratory to conduct remediation experiments on a range of scales. These experiments demonstrate fundamental soil and groundwater transport processes, provide design parameters, and yield data for comparing remediation technologies and testing mathematical models.

SI is a voluntarily-attended, interactive course review program that helps students master course material while they develop and integrate effective learning and study skill strategies. SI does not disrupt the normal lecture or recitation sections of a course. SI was successfully incorporated into IEA as indicated by two main results: 1) students who attended SI received higher course grades than did students who never attended SI and 2) students who attended SI were less likely to receive a final course grade of a D or F, and were thus less likely to withdraw from the engineering program. Since a majority (66%) of SI attendees was composed of at-risk students (who received a letter grade of “C” on at least one of the four course examinations) and high-risk students (who received a letter grade of “D” or “F” on at least one of the four course examinations), SI was helping those who had the most to gain from the experience.

Yet, traditional pedagogical tools are ill-equipped to develop this holistic view in students. In this paper, we describe a Virtual Factory Teaching System, VFTS, now under development to provide a tool to illustrate the concepts of factory management and design in a realistic setting.

Historically, universities have taken the responsibility for rigorous theoretical and technical training in subjects that include the basic sciences and fundamentals of engineering, while industry has been responsible for making engineering graduates contributors to specific tasks important to the company and its core competency. In this division of training, however, no one teaches students how to apply fundamental engineering principles to practical problems. To make matters worse, faculty often ignore engineering relevance of basic theory and the students then reject these fundamentals; in both cases engineering performance suffers.

Men and women are remarkably similar in their abilities, academic experiences, and career influences. Women, however, are more likely to anticipate that lack of confidence in their own abilities and conflicts between work and family responsibilities will be barriers to success in their careers.

For the purposes of this project the NCEES agreed to release information to the University of Missouri-Rolla (UMR) to permit the value of the FE data in describing UMR student learning in key engineering and science topics to be assessed. The analysis of the FE data was undertaken in the period 1993–1996 for students in twelve engineering disciplines at UMR. The overall conclusion of the project is that the enhanced level of data released from the FE by NCEES is of value to individual programs, schools and institutions in assessing student learning and in identifying areas of concern. However, the overall value of this information is compromised by variable student motivation and the confidentiality of the questions used in the exam. Other conclusions are that UMR student scores are below faculty expectations, that the FE exam is not equally applicable to all engineering disciplines, and that the academic level of the exam may be lower than faculty thought.",na,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.1998.tb00358.x,349

Assessing Teaming Skills Acquisition on Undergraduate Project Teams,1998,149,155,Philip Lewis***Dayne Aldridge***Paul M. Swamidass,Department of Psychology Auburn University***College of Engineering Auburn University***Department of Management Auburn University,NA,87,2,"Much of what students learn about teaming is procedural or practical knowledge, acquired through direct experience on teams that promote good team processes and self reflection. Assessment of teaming competence should follow a simple, three-step model where 1) goals are stated, 2) the “essential ingredients” thought to promote those goals are identified and assessed, and 3) the impact of the teaming experience on students is measured. By examining the links between teaming ingredients and their impact on students, a feedback loop is established that should help faculty learn more about the “art” of teaching teaming skills and thereby help faculty engage in continuous improvement of their instructional efforts. Various assessment methods and strategies are illustrated. The issue of promoting multidisciplinary teaming competence is discussed, and the desirability of a progressive sequence of student teaming experiences advocated.",na,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.1998.tb00335.x,360

The lessons learned from the Synthesis Coalition's experience can be applied at the departmental level to meet the requirements of these agencies. The planning strategy focused on a collaborative process that involved all stakeholders: faculty, administrators, students, and industry representatives. The stakeholders validated and prioritized the Coalition's original goals and identified a specific set of abilities, criteria, and activities associated with them. (The goals included, to facilitate: communication, teamwork, hands-on facility with hardware, awareness of the social implications of engineering, modern industry practices, multi-disciplinary design, and open-ended problem solving.) The Coalition's industrial board provided written scenarios of “day in the life” challenges engineers face to help ensure that the values and goals the Coalition planned to assess matched those that industry felt were important. Next, course documents were analyzed to identify a set of assignments to use for developing authentic, performance-based assessment tools. This approach assured that by participating in the Synthesis Coalition assessment project, each campus prepared a core group of faculty to assess (and train other faculty to assess) student learning and ultimately document evidence of student learning for ABET accreditation.",na,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.1998.tb00336.x,361
Computerized Assessment Technique for Large Classes,1998,167,172,Sudhir I. Mehta***Nem W. Schlecht,Mechanical Engineering Department North Dakota State University***Information Technology Services North Dakota State University,NA,87,2,"The primary purpose of classroom assessment is to determine how well students are learning on a continuous basis and to take necessary corrective action as soon as possible to improve their learning. This paper describes a computerized assessment technique that can be used effectively and easily in large classes. The technique allows instructors and students to monitor the learning process on a daily basis and to quickly point out the need for corrective action, if necessary. Students can view their performance and also the average class performance on the web. The graphical displays allow them to see the trend of their performance over several days. Several reports, automatically generated for instructors, allow them to determine promptly how well certain concepts or topics are learned by students. Use of special codes and optical scanning sheets minimize paper shuffling in large classes, and the computer program automatically grades and updates the database. The program is fairly general and has friendly interfaces; thus, it can be implemented for use by faculty at other universities. According to student response sheets, 80 to 97 percent of the students find different aspects of the technique to be effective in improving teaching-learning in large classes.",na,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.1998.tb00337.x,362

Although the sample was too small to support general conclusions, the findings were so consistent that they are presented as a possible stimulus to faculty members and others to make the same observations at other institutions. The survey supports the conclusion that computers are usually not used effectively in undergraduate engineering science courses. Often, they are not used at all. Problem-solving approaches and calculation methods are little influenced by the availability of computers. Typically, faculty members reacted to this conclusion with disbelief and denial until they made their own observations. Speculation is offered on why faculty members do not use computers effectively in engineering science courses and why they initially deny the conclusion above. The challenge suggested for faculty members and industrial advisory board members is to make similar observations.

Granting of Academic Credit for Work Based Learning in Scottish Higher Education,1998,15,17,N. S. Edward,"School of Mechanical and Offshore Engineering The Robert Gordon University, Aberdeen, Scotland",NA,87,1,"This paper explores the benefits and costs of formal Work Based Learning (WBL) programmes. It is based on my experience and on the responses of participating employers, learners, and academics in a number of Scottish Institutions to an open questionnaire. Benefits to the employer depended on whether the learner was a full-time student in placement or a company employee in part-time study. In the former case, employers were often surprised at the contribution made by the student and valued contact with the University. The potential for developing their employees in an environment which allowed theory and practice to be related was valued in the latter case. Academics identified closer links with industry and increasing the attractiveness of their courses among the advantages. Part-time students often got an opportunity to advance their qualifications which would otherwise have been denied them. These and other advantages both predictable and unexpected are reviewed. Perhaps the most cogent benefit has been that through awarding of academic credit and the more rigorous approach, the aims of less formal industrial placements are now being achieved. All participants reported attendant costs and problems. These included the logistical problems of planning, mounting, and validating credit for what are often individual schemes for each student, and of assessing student performance. Diversion of organisational effort from its business objectives is mirrored in the need for the college to provide alternatives where learning outcomes cannot be met in the workplace. Obtaining equivalence of opportunity and of assessment standards was of major concern to academics and students alike. Incumbent costs to the organisation were mainly the opportunity costs of diverted equipment and staff. Students often had displacement costs in accommodation travel and low pay. Colleges found that the funding attracted by such schemes generally did not match their true costs. The consensus of opinion, however, was found to be that the benefits outweighed the costs. WBL was seen as a useful option provided it was carefully planned and monitored.",na,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.1998.tb00316.x,371

The Defining Issues Test (DIT), which is based on cognitive moral development theory, was used as the instrument of assessment. Students were pretested, taught a course on engineering ethics, and posttested at the end of the semester. In the Fall of 1995, a total of 301 students participated in the study with 162 students completing the DIT at both the pretest and posttest. In the Spring of 1996, a total of 263 students participated in the study with 155 students completing the DIT at both the pretest and posttest. Analysis of the data revealed a statistically significant increase in the moral reasoning skills of the students for both semesters. Statistical analysis revealed a significant correlation between the change in moral reasoning scores and age in the Spring semester with younger students showing more change but not in the Fall semester. There was no significant relationship between the moral reasoning scores and gender at either the pretest or the posttest, nor in the rate of change by gender. This study demonstrates that the teaching of ethics in engineering can be rigorously measured, tested and analyzed and that it can have a significant positive influence on the moral reasoning skills of the students.

The three components require varying degrees of commitment to an international dimension. The components are: 1) Insertion of an International Dimension at the Syllabus Level, 2) Integration of an International Dimension at the Curricular Level, and 3) Immersion in a Foreign Instructional Environment. The insertion and integrated components rely on the Internet and videoconferencing technology. These two components have come to be known as the “Reciprocal Distance Education Model.” The third component of the model is a blend of traditional study abroad programs with international internships and reciprocal student exchange programs.",na,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.1999.tb00468.x,391
Multimedia Collaborative Content Creation (mc3): The MSU Lecture Online System*,1999,421,427,Gerd Kortemeyer***Wolfgang Bauer,Division of Science and Mathematics Education Michigan State University***National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory and Department of Physics and Astronomy Michigan State University,NA,88,4,"Putting lecture material on-line is a time-consuming undertaking. Before communicating any subject matter, faculty must invest time and effort in dealing with computer-related administrative overhead. Also, in traditional lecture preparations, faculty can profit from years of previously prepared written material, while for on-line classes, they often unnecessarily re-create learning modules that already exist on-line. Lecture Online is a means for faculty to develop modular on-line resources collaboratively and share them with each other.

Articulate Virtual Labs in Thermodynamics Education: A Multiple Case Study*,1999,429,434,Julie Baher,Institute for the Learning Sciences Northwestern University,NA,88,4,"This paper describes the use of CyclePad—an articulate virtual laboratory for creating and analyzing thermodynamics cycles—at three different types of educational institutions: a research university, an engineering technology program in a large state university, and a military academy. Case studies of each site were created based on classroom observations, student surveys, and interviews with faculty. In comparing these three institutions, we found that the context of the school and the ways in which professors chose to implement CyclePad led to different student experiences. Depending on the types of problems that students worked on, they found the software more or less helpful in increasing their understanding of thermodynamics.

Awoniyi,Department of Industrial Engineering FAMU-FSU College of Engineering,NA,88,4,"This paper presents a template that departments may use to organize their efforts to satisfy ABET Engineering Criteria 2000 requirements. The template is based on the premise that each course in a BS curriculum should be designed to service well-defined “Student Learning Tasks” that have been derived from program objectives. The template is such that, as a department creates files and documents to fill it, “Objectives of the Department” will derive from stakeholder demands; “Graduate Attributes” will derive from “Objectives of the Department”; a set of “Student Learning Tasks” will be associated with each “Graduate Attribute”; courses comprising the BS degree curriculum will cover all “Student Learning Tasks”; and a suitable scheme of assessment and self-evaluation will connect all elements together for continuous improvement purposes. The template helps to clarify relations among EC 2000 components, and sifts content from format in doing so.

This paper presents the results of a survey of the ethics-related course requirements of virtually all engineering programs in the U.S. Even with a liberal definition of “ethics-related topics,” the data reveal that only about one-fourth of the institutions surveyed require all of their engineering undergraduates to take at least one course in which ethics or ethics-related topics were listed in the catalog description. Because the institutions with extensive ethics course requirements tended to be small, only about one out of five students who graduated from accredited programs in 1996–97 came from an institution with such a requirement.

A criterion-referenced, rather than the typical norm-referenced scheme, was supplemented with a reward system designed to value students with a diverse set of academic talents. For example, the ability to solve “traditional looking” engineering analysis problems and the ability to thoroughly explain how phenomena occur (independent of the ability to work to a final “answer”) were equally valued. Value was measured by the course grade. The goals of the experiment were: (1) to ensure that all students who succeeded in the class possessed a baseline competence in the subject matter; (2) to value (in the form of high grades) a diverse set of talents; and (3) to encourage students to develop good learning habits. The experiment was implemented by teaching a sophomore core engineering course with a team of two faculty members and two graduate teaching assistants handling 187 students. One faculty member was responsible for the classroom teaching activities while the other focused exclusively on developing and implementing the evaluation instruments. The instruments consisted of four types of examinations, each designed for a specific purpose and administered at distinct times during the semester. Quantitative results, including associated statistical analyses, are given. We conclude that it is possible to establish criterion-referenced schemes that value student skill diversity while encouraging good study and learning habits.

The three levels of assessment are based on a three level customer needs model developed by Kano. In the context of the Kano model, faculty are viewed as customers and student work is the product. Three part checklists consistent with this model are used; these checklists facilitate the assessment of technical correctness, other course standards, student readiness, as well as the level and quality of the effort.

The lack of preparation in applying mathematical concepts may be due to the fact that examples from engineering disciplines are not widely used in mathematics courses. Most mathematics departments act as service departments to students majoring in various fields in addition to providing their own degree programs. As a result, it is not economically justifiable for them to custom tailor courses for customers from different disciplines. On the other hand, engineering has a distinct requirement of creatively applying mathematical concepts and principles to engineering problems studied in various courses. Some of the issues that must be addressed to ensure adequate preparation in the application of mathematics include: the mathematical competencies needed in engineering courses; which mathematics courses should cover such competencies; and what examples and problems related to students' major field should be developed and taught in these courses to enhance understanding and application of these concepts.

The Role of Undergraduate Honors Theses in a Computer Engineering Program,1999,345,352,Sumit Ghosh,Department of Computer Science & Engineering Arizona State University,NA,88,3,"This paper is the result of a 7-year long experiment that I had initiated in 1989 as an attempt to integrate the tradition of undergraduate honors research at Brown University with the emerging ABET requirement of engineering design in the computer engineering program. The paper presents the philosophical principles, the underlying assumptions and goals of the experiment, and the character of the experiences learned at the conclusion of the experiment. The experiment involves a total of 17 students between 1989 and 1995, all of whom successfully complete their honors thesis. Most of the theses have been published in refereed conferences and journals, reflecting the quality of the work and the fundamental nature of the concepts learned by the graduating seniors. The experiment demonstrates a feasible approach to achieving ABET's goal of developing student creativity within the framework of the current faculty reward structure. The students emerge as self-confident and highly creative individuals, capable of critical, analytical thinking, and appreciative of the depth of knowledge. Key experiences that I had gained include the realization that every student, regardless of their prior grades in conventional courses, holds unlimited potential. This experiment witnesses the development of an amazingly sincere motivation and superior commitment when the advisor demonstrates genuine belief in students' capabilities and expresses gratitude to them for the value of their work and for the opportunity to collaborate.

Small companies are becoming the primary employers of engineers and technologists, who must assume multidisciplinary roles. Multidisciplinary projects can provide students with valuable preparation for this requirement. The objectives of the work described in this paper are: 1) help technology students develop, to some extent, the abilities of engineering students, 2) to enhance technology students' interest in a multidisciplinary curriculum. To help achieve these objectives, students at Temple University were given an electromechanical project to design a model of a smart conveyor belt system that could recognize the size of different blocks. Statistical analysis of a confidential student survey showed that a significant number of students positively rated the benefits of working on the project. Survey performance indices included pedagogy, interactions with Electrical Engineering students and faculty, and obtaining hands-on experience. Project students scored statistically higher on a theory test, and 34% of the students were motivated to complete a minor in electromechanical engineering technology because of the interdisciplinary project.",na,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.1999.tb00427.x,429

The evolution of engineering as a response to societal and personal needs has created, together with technical challenges, ethical dimensions akin to more service-oriented professions. Several frameworks of ethics have been suggested to incorporate and address these dimensions. In this paper, the ethic of care is singled out due to the natural analogy between engineering and care: they both respond to a need and are oriented towards action. The suitability of care to provide guiding principles is supported by highlighting the distinguishing features that make the ethic of care especially relevant to engineering.

Instead of having everyone in the class perform identical activities (homework, experiments, projects, tests, etc.), a cadre of assignments is made available to them. Students choose and perform (within reason) the ones that suit them better in terms of their own strengths and learning styles. The ultimate goal is for each student to demonstrate a minimum level of competence in analytical, computational, experimental, design, communication, and team skills, while pursuing excellence in at least one from the first four categories.

This schism has prompted industry, government, and other key constituents to question the relevancy and efficacy of current programs. The Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) Engineering Criteria 2000, which will be fully implemented in 2001, emphasizes outcomes over process, and provides an opportunity for stakeholders to help universities define educational goals and objectives and design a curriculum to meet the desired outcomes.1 While the need for curriculum reform has been acknowledged, the “industry position” was amorphous and anecdotal and therefore difficult to address. Qualitative methodologies such as formal surveys and structured interviews can be used to capture and quantify industry expectations of the needed attributes (i.e., knowledge, skills, and experience) for entry level engineering employees.

This study represents an attempt to quantify attitudes toward gender bias among professional women engineers working in the State of Kuwait. The major findings that emerged from the study were as follows: a) Since 1970, Kuwait has witnessed an enormous growth rate in the participation of women in higher education. b) With respect to the job-related factors of salary scale, professional treatment, responsibility, benefits, and vacation, a clear majority of the professional Kuwaiti women engineers surveyed expressed a feeling of equality with or even superiority to their male counterparts. c) The one job-related factor in which significant gender bias was found to be in operation was that of promotion to upper management positions. In this criterion, the women engineers surveyed felt “less than equal” to their male colleagues. The feeling of employment equality reported by the survey population was found to be positively correlated with level of education, years of work experience, and grade point average. These relationships were all significant statistically. Among the job-related factors contributing to the feeling of equality, were, in order of importance, professional treatment, promotion, level of responsibility, and the opportunity to reach upper management positions. Interestingly enough, salary scale contributed the least to the feeling of equality.

The system consists of two components and works backwards, starting with teaching students the assessment strategy (rubric) to be used in evaluating their work. Therefore, the first system component or rubric becomes a guide to teach students how to connect their ideas (sentence subjects) in sequence without ambiguity or implied connectivity. The second component of the system consists of written assignments initiated with “work orders” that state specifically what is expected of the student in each paragraph and includes formatting instructions. Finally, the system was designed for use in any technical curriculum by engineering and technology instructors and incorporates research findings and suggestions by four influential professional writing associations: 1) the college teachers of English for Science and Technology (EST), 2) the Conference on College Composition and Communication (CCCC) Committee on Assessment, 3) the National Council of Teachers of English (NCTE), and 4) Writing Across the Curriculum (WAC).",na,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.2000.tb00544.x,469

Heragu,Department Mississippi State University***Department Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute***Department Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute,NA,89,4,"This report summarizes the proceedings of a roundtable discussion of materials handling educational issues by a panel consisting of practitioners in the materials handling industry. The objective of the discussion was to: (i) understand how practitioners apply their engineering expertise to industrial problems, (ii) identify critical skills and attributes required of practicing materials handling engineers, and (iii) determine how ties between universities and the practicing community could be strengthened to prepare material handling students for successful careers in the material handling industry. The discussion was centered around five issues related to the above objectives. The panel felt that a vast majority of the materials handling problems faced by practitioners fall in the operational analysis category. Simulation modeling, group problem solving, project management and simple operational analysis based on fundamental mechanical and electrical engineering principles appear to be the primary analytic methods used for problem solving. Graduating engineers entering the materials handling field must possess strong communication, interpersonal and analytical skills, be able to organize and lead a project successfully, and exhibit a high degree of creativity. Because the role of a materials handling engineer will often be that of an internal consultant, they must be able to lead and work effectively in multi-disciplinary teams. Increased automation on the shop-floor and globalization of the business world demand that the engineer have a strong multi-disciplinary background. Materials handling students in the nation's universities must be familiar with various equipment types including their functionality, applications, strengths and weaknesses, have a firm grasp of the analytical and simulation based problem solving tools, and be able to take the “big picture,” systems approach in problem solving. Classroom instruction must include project and case based learning and coverage of theoretical topics. While the former is important for students to be able to solve practical problems, the latter is valuable for imparting analytical skills and creativity.

Theme course graduates claim better retention of concepts from the sophomore course, though their scores on exam questions testing their knowledge, comprehension, and application of these concepts did not differ significantly from that of students from the traditional course. Theme course graduates did earn higher grades in the junior course, due to better performance on exam questions requiring higher level skills such as analysis, synthesis, and evaluation.

The survey included queries regarding availability of computer resources and access to the Internet, preferences for delivery technology, type of educational program of interest, subject areas of interest, and importance of various parameters associated with distance learning programs. Approximately 1,000 surveys were mailed with a response rate of about 15 percent. The survey clearly defined preferences of this population for computer-based delivery technology and programs related to engineering management, computer science and engineering, and mechanical/manufacturing engineering. The information collected will be used to define the content areas, delivery technology, and pedagogical framework of future distance learning courses and programs.",na,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.2000.tb00522.x,486
A Dramatic Method to Demonstrate Concurrent Engineering in the Classroom,2000,265,267,Terri Friel,MMACS Department Eastern Kentucky University,NA,89,3,"Conceptualizing concurrent engineering is an easy task for students, usually. However, they find it difficult to understand the forces preventing concurrent engineering from being supported.

These include increased creativity, productivity, and reduced time-to-market of engineering concepts. Good team skills are desired by engineering employers, prompting universities to focus on curriculum development with strong team utilization. While team projects significantly increase opportunities for team interaction, they rarely provide sufficient training to enable students to function most effectively in a team environment. In addition, there is lack of standardization in how teams are used, and inconsistency in team performance expectations and training. These concerns led to our current efforts to develop a standardized team-training format for faculty and students. To provide the basis for development of team training materials, faculty interviews and student focus groups were conducted to assess perceptions of team project work and training as well as expectations and definitions of successful team performance. of student focus groups on team project class experiences are discussed.",na,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.2000.tb00524.x,488

We report here the results of a survey of engineering faculty at the coalition universities to identify the training needs and present levels of experience with various technologies. The most surprising finding is that, despite the wide differences in the Coalition's colleges of engineering, the survey results are similar for all campuses. This implies that the results may be widely applicable to other universities. Generally, we found that the faculty's interest in receiving training in a specific technology is highly correlated with a low skill level for that topic, as expected.

Little is known, however, about the interactional dynamics among students in engineering work groups. To explore these dynamics and their implications for engineering education, we analyzed work sessions of student groups in a sophomore-level chemical engineering course at North Carolina State University. Using conversation analysis as a methodology for understanding how students taught and learned from one another, we found that group members generally engaged in two types of teaching-learning interactions. In the first type, transfer-of-knowledge (TK) sequences, they took on distinct teacher and pupil roles, and in the second, collaborative sequences (CS), they worked together with no clear role differentiation. The interactional problems that occurred during the work sessions were associated primarily with TK sequences, and had to do with students who either habitually assumed the pupil's role (constant pupils) or habitually discouraged others' contributions (blockers). Our findings suggest that professors can facilitate student group interactions by introducing students to the two modes of teaching interaction so group members can effectively manage exchanges of knowledge, and also by helping students distribute tasks in a way that minimizes role imbalances.",na,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.2000.tb00527.x,491

Mentoring programs that target individuals in underrepresented groups or groups of individuals who, statistically, are not likely to succeed are especially effective. These programs are effective because the mentors provide the protégés with a common community and help them anticipate future decisions. The purpose of this paper is to present an electronic mentoring (E-Mentoring) program designed and established at Northeastern University to provide long-term mentoring experiences for pre-college and college female engineering students. Participants from four different age groups join E-Mentor clubs and develop relationships through regular e-mail communication. Networking socials, scheduled 3–4 times a year, provide the participants an opportunity to interact “face-to-face.” The E-Mentoring program began as a pilot program in the Fall of 1996 within the Civil and Environmental Engineering Department and has grown to a college-wide program with approximately 250 participants in the Spring of 1999.",na,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.2000.tb00528.x,492

Because the task of generating an effective plan requires knowledge, time, patience, and persistence, not all organizations are prepared to devote the time and energy that is required to produce a meaningful plan. It is the intent of this paper to describe an approach to quality planning which was used to make major curricular changes in the first-year engineering education program at Texas A&M University.

Study results indicate there is no statistically relevant difference in learning between students using material presented with traditional multimedia (35 mm slides and cassette tapes) and the identical material presented with digital multimedia. Engineering students' preferences for interface design and audio-visual information presentation are also presented. The most important result is that learning outcomes of a reader-driven CBT module were found to be statistically lower than those associated with author-driven CBT module, especially for average and below-average students. These results suggest that if students must absolutely understand material, e.g., laboratory safety, the CBT should be author-driven. Based on these results, we speculate that average and below average engineering students are more linear learners.

Some engineering programs are looking at using course grades as evidence that students are meeting the learning outcomes mandated by Criterion 3 of EC2000. After all, if there is a course in engineering design, why shouldn't grades be used to demonstrate that students are acquiring the skills necessary to meet the required outcome?

However, modeling courses often focus on just one, or at most a few, of the steps and frequently are assignment-driven. Moreover, they often present numerical procedures as recipes, without regard to theory or limitations and without regard to “real-world” application. In this course, we unify the modeling sequence by exposing students to the full spectrum of modeling (mathematics, physics, and numerical methods) in the context of surfactant-enhanced remediation of contaminated soils, a technology being developed at the University of Oklahoma. An innovative course structure is used that couples team learning with a project-driven syllabus (also referred to as just-in-time learning) and combines mathematical and physical modeling via data from laboratory and field testing. Other thematic areas can easily be developed in the same framework. We believe the course pedagogy is highly portable and can serve as an example for any modeling course or for many other courses in an engineering curriculum.",na,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.2000.tb00514.x,519

Streveler,Division of Engineering Colorado School of Mines***Office of Teaching Effectiveness Colorado School of Mines,NA,89,1,"Adjunct faculty can offer enrichment to an engineering program by bringing practical experience and by introducing relevant industrial applications and problems to the classroom. The industrial perspective of adjunct faculty often manifests itself through an emphasis on communication and presentation skills, and concern for customer needs. Students observing these attributes come away with a better appreciation for the demands of the engineering workplace. Adjunct faculty members can also provide important linkages for developing industrial affiliate programs, co-op activities, and employment opportunities for graduates. Nevertheless, the position of adjunct faculty is tenuous, subject to shifting enrollments, negative student perception, and limited connectivity with the mainstream issues of the academic department. Adjunct faculty who teach in engineering programs will almost always come with excellent technical credentials, but they will have little or no teacher training or knowledge of learning principles and cognitive psychology. With limited time on campus, adjunct faculty have little opportunity to improve their teaching skills and methods, resulting in a “sink or swim” environment. At the Colorado School of Mines (CSM), we have evolved a regimen of strategies to ensure the quality of the educational program and to support the teaching effectiveness and professional commitment of adjunct faculty.

This paper reports on a two-semester experiment in which students were required to provide a confidence rating for all exam and quiz answers. The structure allowed for expressing positive confidence (confidence that an answer is correct), negative confidence (confidence that an answer is incorrect), and neutral confidence. A confidence score that measured how well the students evaluated the correctness or incorrectness of their answers was combined with a traditional problem score to form the exam score.

Gender and Ethnicity Differences in Freshmen Engineering Student Attitudes: A Cross-Institutional Study*,2001,477,489,Mary Besterfield-Sacre***Magaly Moreno***Larry J. Shuman***Cynthia J. Atman,Department of Industrial Engineering University of Pittsburgh***Operations Research and Decision Support Group American Airlines***School of Engineering University of Pittsburgh***Director of the Center for Engineering Learning and Teaching University of Washington,NA,90,4,"We examine the attitudes of entering freshman engineering students and how they change over the course of the first year at 17 institutions. In addition to better understanding these attitudes and the changes that occur, we explore how these changes potentially affect such issues as “first term probation” and attrition from engineering programs. Particular attention is directed at isolating differences due to gender and ethnicity. Thirteen different student attitudes were captured using the Pittsburgh Freshman Engineering Attitude Survey© (PFEAS) at the beginning of the first semester (pre) and at either the end of the first semester or first academic year (post). Definite gender differences were found on the pre-survey for five of the attitude measures. For all but one of these measures, female engineering students' initial attitudes were more negative than those of male students. Across the sample of institutions, female students consistently began their engineering studies with a lower confidence in background knowledge about engineering, their abilities to succeed in engineering, and their perceptions of how engineers contribute to society than did their male counterparts. However, those same female students were more comfortable with their study habits than were the male students. The post questionnaire data indicated that differences for three of these five attitude measures persisted. Most important, female engineering students continued to maintain a lower confidence in their abilities to succeed in engineering as compared to male engineering students. When the PFEAS data were mapped into EC 2000 outcomes, comparable cross-institutional gender differences were observed that paralleled those found for the attitudinal measures. Because the number of minority students was relatively small, significant cross-institutional differences between each minority cohort studied (African American, Asian Pacific, and Hispanic) and the majority cohort, similar cross-institutional patterns could not be observed. However, possible trends were found between African American and majority students' attitudes for certain measures, while other attitudinal measures were found to be significant when Hispanic students were compared to majority students. Significant attitudinal differences between Asian Pacific and majority students were similar to those found between female and male engineering students. By knowing how attitudinal measures differ among gender and ethnic cohorts, and understanding how those differences relate to attrition from engineering programs, we can then developed more informed programmatic initiatives that can impact these attitude in a positive manner. As a result, we may be able to reduce engineering attrition, especially by underrepresented student cohorts.",na,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.2001.tb00629.x,544

The study spanned from 1994–1999 and involved a graduate level project-based course at Stanford University. A web-based design information system was put in place to enable project teams to store design information, and to access information previously stored by their peer teams from the current year and from prior years. Quantitative analyses of access logs to the system identified patterns of usage, and qualitative interviews identified social issues on such usage. The analyses answer two underlying assumptions associated with such systems to show that with regards to re-use: 1) more data do not correlate with more usage, and 2) more usage does not necessarily correlate with higher performance, except when over a longer-term basis. Additionally, patterns of usage show a significantly higher ratio of access to process-related files than to project-related files, and show a temporal access pattern that is demand-driven and closely matches project deliverables and milestones. User interviews identified social factors that significantly influence how teams use the system, such as teaching staff recommending particular information to particular teams.",na,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.2001.tb00634.x,549

Multidisciplinary student groups invent a new electrical, mechanical, or electromechanical game or toy, design it, and build a working prototype. The prototype is then delivered to an internationally-known toy and game agency. The best of the prototypes are then presented by the agency to major national and international game and toy companies. If the toy or game is selected for production, the possibility exists for significant financial benefit both for the school and the students. Real world considerations such as creativity, project feasibility, and costs (particularly in mass quantity), all factor into the ultimate student goal, which is to have their project selected by the agents. The burden of devising the projects is largely removed from the professor and copying from earlier projects is virtually impossible. Design of a good game or toy is often much more difficult than it appears—projects invariably knit together the many engineering skills a student has acquired through the course of obtaining a bachelor's degree as well as from the rest of their life experiences.

The results indicate that although a relatively small percentage of faculty have chosen to adopt Cooperative Learning as a teaching tool in their courses, the impact on student attitudes and learning is significant, making the effort worthwhile.",na,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.2001.tb00658.x,573
Exploring the Gender Gap in Engineering: A Re-Specification and Test of the Hypothesis of Cumulative Advantages and Disadvantages,2001,677,684,Valerie A. Haines***Jean E. Wallace***M. Elizabeth Cannon,Department of Sociology University of Calgary***Department of Sociology University of Calgary***Department of Geomatics University of Calgary,NA,90,4,"Researchers using the hypothesis of cumulative advantages and disadvantages argue that the accumulation of small advantages for men and small disadvantages for women contributes to the gender gap in engineering. This paper uses data from a 1998 survey of engineering undergraduates to test a re-specification of this hypothesis that treats the gender distribution of advantages and disadvantages as an empirical question. We considered four sets of factors that have been shown to promote choice of an engineering major, persistence in engineering, and progress in engineering: family background, high school participation in mathematics and science, university participation in engineering, and integration into engineering. We found gender differences for each set of factors. We also found that men and women accumulate different advantages and disadvantages as they move through the education pipeline. By demonstrating that the accumulation of advantages and disadvantages is gendered, these results highlight the importance of examining the impact of micro-inequities on the persistence and progress of men and women in engineering.",na,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.2001.tb00659.x,574

The apprenticeship model of learning is utilized to create a learning environment for the study of a one-dimensional proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiment, with the goal of linking theoretical knowledge with practical operational experience. Active, exploratory, apprentice-style learning is supported via modes of operation within the system. Students can flexibly choose to “observe the expert” perform and explain operational steps, or “act as an apprentice” and carry out the steps autonomously. Students can switch between modes at their discretion, giving them control of the level of system intervention. Students can also explore and reflect on an “information space” of objects, procedures, and related concepts. UIUC-VS extends a previous tutorial application, LEMRS,1 using Java-based, Web-capable technologies to provide a basis for a shared simulation environment teaching NMR. As a computer-supported collaborative learning environment, the system includes a method of asynchronous communication, where the student can post questions and comments to a “question board,” with the ability to capture the current state of the system via annotations on a screen capture.

Following a carefully designed program philosophy, the emphasis in the core curriculum changes through the entire four-year program in three progressive stages, from the acquisition of knowledge, to integration and analysis, and finally to synthesis and design. This is reflected in an increased concentration of mathematics and basic science courses in first and second year, engineering science courses in third year, and engineering design courses (capstone courses) in fourth year. Two tools which concisely illustrate the course curriculum and curriculum content are: (1) the flow sheet, which can contain a wealth of information, such as showing linkages between courses (e.g. how upper-level courses can build on lower-level courses through course prerequisites), the timing of various courses, courses taught within the home department (vs. other departments), and courses taught by professional engineers; and (2) the ternary phase diagram, which is a quantitative method of displaying engineering content within individual courses or an entire program and can clearly show patterns and trends in curriculum content with time. Such tools are useful for academic engineering programs which may have to undergo an accreditation review and are readily adapted to any other engineering fields of study. Other engineering elements woven throughout the program include strong interactions with professional engineering faculty, the use of student teams, enhanced communication skills, and exposure to important aspects of professional engineering practice such as engineering ethics and law. To ensure that the curriculum is kept current and relevant, formative evaluation instruments such as questionnaires are used in all years of study, and are also sent to recent graduates of the program.

Some of these approaches have been referred to as using “studio” methods, although the particular pedagogy appears to vary greatly. In this paper, some of these experiments are briefly reviewed and placed in a larger context of studio education in other disciplines. The paper seeks to differentiate studio education from other active learning approaches. An introductory engineering design course was taught using an architecture studio model for two semesters. The experiment demonstrated that the studio method can be very effective in teaching design concepts, but because students are likely to be unfamiliar with this approach, care must be taken to reassure students regarding grades and expectations.",na,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.2001.tb00610.x,587

Six teams worked on an intensive three-hour problem-solving event as part of their term project. Successful completion of the project depended on using engineering skills to solve an open-ended technical problem and produce a one-page memo defining the solution. The skills needed for this exercise included searching electronic databases for relevant information, analyzing journal publications, developing a kinetic model, applying the model to the problem, making team decisions, and communicating the results in a written product. Three teams performed the exercise in a technology-training classroom (treatment group), newly constructed and flexibly furnished to accommodate interaction and electronic communication. The remaining three teams (control group) were to find any available space within the Engineering complex. The technology classroom featured flexible, team-friendly furnishing, and laptop computers with wireless Ethernet connections, giving the students access to Internet database resources and nearby printers. None of the teams selecting their own space chose to work in a traditional classroom. Rather, they all migrated to space that could be used for group discussion, and left these areas to get access to other resources. All groups performed well as teams, probably due to the team training that had been provided to the class prior to the exercise.

The goal of the research project presented here was to examine the effectiveness of CL as perceived by SMET faculty who use it in the classroom at member institutions of the Puerto Rico Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (PR-LSAMP). As a long-term goal, PR-LSAMP researchers desired to use the findings to understand and address the training needs of their SMET faculty. Data was gathered on faculty members' use of CL and their perceptions of the effect of CL strategies on student performance and attitudes. Principal survey results showed that over 60% of faculty felt confident in their knowledge of CL theory and role assignment, although somewhat less confident in conflict resolution, grading activities and individual accountability. Fifty percent (50%) reported using the strategy very often or often (primarily for the exploration and learning of new concepts, in team projects and presentations, and in quizzes). Forty-one percent (41%) described their experience in implementing CL as excellent or very good. In addition, faculty perceived more positive than negative changes in student performance and attitudes. Based on study results, researchers concluded that the success of cooperative learning in PR-LSAMP institutions signals the beginning of a paradigm shift in the islands' educational system.

The primary objective of such courses is to teach engineering design fundamentals utilizing repeatable design techniques. By so doing, students obtain (1) tools they may employ during their education, (2) design experiences to understand the “big picture” of engineering, and (3) proven methods to attack open-ended problems. While these skills are worthwhile, especially as design courses are moved earlier in curricula, many students report that design methods are typically taught at a high-level and in a compartmentalized fashion. Often, the students' courses do not include opportunities to obtain incremental concrete experiences with the methods. Nor do such courses allow for suitable observation and reflection as the methods are executed. In this paper, we describe a new approach for teaching design methods that addresses these issues. This approach incorporates hands-on experiences through the use of “reverse-engineering” projects. As the fundamentals of design techniques are presented, students immediately apply the methods to actual, existing products. They are able to hold these products physically in their hands, dissect them, perform experiments on their components, and evolve them into new successful creations. Based on this reverse-engineering concept, we have developed and tested new courses at The University of Texas, MIT, and the United States Air Force Academy.

For the first year students eager to begin their aerospace education and to help those students unsure about selecting aerospace engineering as their major field, the MIT Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics offers an elective course, Introduction to Aerospace and Design. The course makes use of the new opportunities offered by the World Wide Web and provides students a real engineering experience through the hands-on, Lighter-Than-Air (LTA) vehicle design project. The course teaches the basic concepts of aeronautics, includes lectures on design, and gives an overview of astronautics. The flexibility inherent in the World Wide Web allows us to accommodate the needs of students who require a review of the fundamentals in addition to in- class lecture material and the needs of others who desire to learn advanced material beyond what is presented in lecture. A Web-based Forum greatly facilitated interaction among students, resulting in better vehicle designs and a friendlier classroom environment. The course culminates in an LTA vehicle design competition in which teams of five to six students design and build radio-controlled blimps measuring up to 5 meters in length. The vehicles are flown around the perimeter of a basketball court with the objective of carrying a maximum amount of payload in a minimum amount of time. The students are introduced to real-world engineering practice through oral presentations of their preliminary designs and critical designs in front of a faculty jury.

ABET Program Criteria: Review and Assessment for a Civil Engineering Program,2001,445,455,Enno “Ed” Koehn,Civil Engineering Lamar University,NA,90,3,"Recently, the National Society of Professional Engineers (NSPE) and the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) sponsored programs to recommend changes for the engineering curriculum. In addition, various other studies, such as that conducted by the American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE), investigated methods to strengthen undergraduate education. The present investigation is based on a study of Lamar University civil engineering undergraduate and graduate students as well as practicing alumni. The findings suggest that all three groups, practicing engineers as well as undergraduate and graduate students, perceive that some subject areas are more important than others. For example, greater than 40% of each group identified four subject areas that presently receive or should receive a high level of coverage in the civil engineering curriculum. They include: mathematics through calculus and differential equations; structural and geotechnical engineering; and major design experience or course. In addition, more than 40% of the undergraduates and practicing engineers also perceive that hydraulics/hydrology/water resources presently receive or should receive a high level of coverage. In contrast, graduate students and practitioners also believe that construction management/surveying, and structural/materials and hydraulics laboratories receive or should receive a high level of coverage. These results suggest strong support for the traditional technical aspect of engineering. In addition, they may be interpreted as positive reinforcement for the Engineering Criteria 2000 program requirements. Nevertheless, all three groups rate professional practice issues at a relatively lower percentage. The foregoing are among the various subjects that have been included in the Civil and Similarly Named Engineering Program Criteria that have been adopted by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) as criteria that must be considered in order to satisfy the requirements of an accredited civil engineering degree.",na,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.2001.tb00625.x,602

Integrated Learning: Paradigm for a Unified Approach,2001,213,217,Daniel J. Schneck,Department of Engineering Science and Mechanics Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University,NA,90,2,"All of reality derives from disturbances to equilibrated states (controlled systems). This realization allows one to develop a generic feedback/feedforward control model as a paradigm for all of the laws of physics. The model is formulated from seven fundamental axioms, upon which are based seven corresponding theorems— among them, the one that defines Potential Energy as the source for all of reality. The output—Kinetic Energy—of the model is experienced (feedback signals which are in the form of dimensions of perception: including time, length, mass, temperature and electric charge) by an observer (frame-of-reference) along a doubly-infinite continuum that is arbitrarily divided into seven scales of perception. These range from sub-nuclear to super-cosmic. Adding to scale-of-perception and frame-of-reference the concept of resolution—which includes considerations of structure, order, and relation—completes the tripartite set of elements that are the foundations of knowledge. A minimum-energy principle (controlling system) is introduced to close the loop in the control model. Operationally, this constraint is manifest as “control signals” that attenuate the randomness of transitions among quasi-equilibrated states, forcing such perceived transitions to proceed along optimized paths (“reference signals” in the control model).",na,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.2001.tb00594.x,613

Ethics Instruction in Engineering Education: A (Mini) Meta-Analysis,2001,223,229,David R.

The American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) annual conference proceedings (1996–1999) contain 42 papers that treat engineering ethics as a coherent educational objective. Some of these papers disclose small components that seem to be part of a larger ethics curriculum. Other papers discuss engineering courses that are clearly the department's major ethics commitment. While it would be inappropriate to assume that the 42 papers represent the only means by which engineering students receive ethics instruction, these papers do present a variety of more-or-less defensible approaches and certainly the major intentional approaches of engineering curricula. This paper will develop an analysis of the 42 articles, including a discussion of where ethics is being taught (from both a chronological, and disciplinary perspective), and the six pedagogical approaches used to transfer an understanding of ethics to the student. These approaches include professional codes, humanist readings, theoretical grounding, ethical heuristics, case studies, and service learning.

However, undergraduate bioengineering curricula have not kept pace with the recent rapid growth of biotechnology, bioinformatics, and cellular level bioengineering. It is the premise of this paper that a new baccalaureate core curriculum in cell and tissue engineering is needed to foster the full development of bioengineering as a core engineering discipline. Employment opportunities for baccalaureate Bioengineering graduates in the emerging biologically-based engineering industry (e.g. bioinformatics, cell and tissue engineering, neural engineering) are increasing. We describe a new undergraduate B.S. bioengineering curriculum in cell and tissue engineering with an emphasis in interfacial molecular approaches. This curriculum is integrated with traditional bioengineering topics and has its technical emphasis in molecular biology, nanotechnology, and computational modeling. Thus, the future bioengineer can be expected to design, model, fabricate, and control living systems and their fundamental constituents at the same level of detail as an electrical engineer uses SPICE and CAD tools to develop a microelectronic or micro-electro-mechanical device. Such engineers would be expected to take their place in industry, graduate school, or medicine with a clear mastery of cell and tissue-based bioengineering.",na,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.2001.tb00597.x,616

In this model, learners are seen as persons who continuously alter their conceptions and ideas by working with data, information, and knowledge, i.e. learners as knowledge workers. The most important point in viewing learners as knowledge workers is exactly that the learners change their understanding by working with the information, and that they do that with the help of cognitive tools. I see it as a necessity that the learning environment consists of tools that support them in their learning processes: tools for constructing, processing and observing information, data, and knowledge. Equally important in this new kind of learning situation are tools to establish and maintain focus, manage information overload, to bridge distances in the learning situation, and to communicate.",na,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.2001.tb00568.x,632

The first course focuses on having teams of students take an industrial based project from inception through a conceptual design process culminating in a final design specification. The senior year sequence is structured to have three-five member teams function as a type of “engineering consultant firm” to address externally sponsored projects. The teams initially work with the sponsor to develop a “Product Design Specification (PDS)” as the foundation of the project. The teams then develop the conceptual design of the project during the fall quarter in order to get sponsor approval to move toward final implementation or prototype development during the winter and early spring teams. The course culminates with a day long symposium where each team makes formal presentations of their project and designs to the campus community, the sponsor representatives, and invited guests from the local community and potential industrial sponsors.

Since its inception, the Software Engineering Institute Capability Maturity Model (CMM) has served as a guide for organizations seeking to improve their development practices, through a self-assessment questionnaire. In an effort to assess the maturity of development practices utilized in software engineering courses, an “academic” version of the CMM questionnaire was developed.

There is a performance problem for students who need to combine different skills. Students spend so much time mastering the details that they often miss the point as to why there is a need for scientific computing. Using projects drawn from practical situations, and a good high-level package such as MATLAB**, can overcome much of this. The difficulty associated with learning scientific programming is greatly alleviated. This in turn frees time for studying more advanced methods. The need to combine ideas from different areas makes this an ideal candidate for both team-teaching and student teamwork on the projects.

The obvious assignment, a group programming project, proved to be a poor choice when implemented in my computer graphics class. An examination of the literature in this area shows that a group programming project has many features in common with a group term paper, the assignment that has been uniquely identified as the worst choice for small group work. Fortunately, there are better choices for cooperative learning in computer science. Assignments with “the three S's“: Same problem, Specific choice, and Simultaneous reporting of group choices, work well. This was implemented in my class by having students work multiple choice quizzes designed to require high level learning skills. Quizzes were first worked by individuals, then by small groups. The small group answers are then compared and discussed in class. This generates the type of interaction between the professor and students which creates positive cooperative learning experiences.

One recent effort was to restructure a first-year nuclear engineering/health physics course. Using nuclear techniques, students were required to solve a fictitious murder. In the process they learned about teamwork, nuclear forensics methods, radiation protection, and basic radiation interactions. The class members were brought into the mystery playing the part of “graduate students” who helped their police-detective uncle solve the case. To assist in their investigation the students subpoenaed expert “witnesses” to educate them on nuclear principles. The students, through homework, explained their actions, methods, and reasoning to a nontechnical participant (their “uncle“). By building on knowledge gained through interviews and homework, the students were able to solve the mystery. This mode of teaching requires extensive hands-on faculty participation.

Undergraduate education, especially at the sophomore level, is vastly different in this regard. The students are less mature and in many cases have had no introduction to engineering. However, recent technological developments have provided universities with tools to consider undergraduate distance learning seriously.

Science Fiction in the Engineering Classroom to Help Teach Basic Concepts and Promote the Profession,2002,419,423,Albert E. Segall,Department of Engineering Science and Mechanics Pennsylvania State University,NA,91,4,"Although science fiction has appeared in science and physics education for many years, the genre has not been widely used to augment engineering education. Considering the potential for science fiction to help illustrate many common engineering concepts, while at the same time challenging the students to think about the many possibilities of design and technology, this exclusion represents a loss of a valuable resource. In order to begin utilizing this valuable resource, a new freshman-level course was developed that uses science fiction films and literature to illustrate and teach basic engineering concepts. Central to the course delivery is “poking fun” at the disobedience of the laws of nature and misuse of engineering while at the same time teaching the correct behaviors. By illustrating basic engineering concepts in this fashion, students can hopefully develop lasting mental pictures of the way things function and the complexities of design. These images can in turn, help the students with core mechanics classes such as statics and dynamics, as well as help the creative design process. Moreover, by highlighting the valuable role engineering plays in transferring science theory to usable technology, the discussions may also help create a positive image of the profession that could aid recruitment and retention. Finally, the genre can also be used to illustrate the implications of technology and society, along with the many ethical considerations of engineering.",na,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.2002.tb00727.x,659

Students who participated in the program were estimated to have significantly higher odds of five-year graduation and six-year graduation than students who did not participate in the program. A comparison of high school GPAs identified a selection bias, and high school GPA was then used to control for this selection bias in a multiple logistic regression model. While multiple individual cohorts remain statistically significant, the aggregate of all cohorts lacks significance due to the small number of participants and the possible overly stringent penalty imposed by the addition of high school GPA. Nevertheless, the results continue to show the positive trend observed earlier—that Minority Engineering Program participants are 25 percent more likely to be retained and graduate in engineering than students who had similar high school GPA but did not participate in the program—it is expected that continuing longitudinal study will bear out this trend as statistically significant. Although the programs described in this paper have been discontinued as a result of personnel changes, the study of the program is still useful as a contribution to the body of evidence supporting the effectiveness of such programs.",na,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.2002.tb00729.x,661

In-class lectures were replaced with videotaped lectures and other materials that students viewed on the Internet on their own schedule, making it possible to use the live class periods for small, team problem-solving sessions facilitated by the professors and a teaching assistant. By using the eTEACH application to transform course lectures into “homework” and free up the face-to-face class time for working on problems that were similar to homework assignments, the professors effectively reversed the lecture and homework paradigm of a typical large lecture course. A thorough course evaluation over two semesters showed that students who took the online lecture version of the course gave significantly higher ratings to all aspects of the course, including lecture usefulness, professor responsiveness, the course overall, and the instructor. Although a few students missed having the opportunity to ask questions during lectures, about two-thirds of the 531 students surveyed felt it was easier to take notes and understand the lectures presented via eTEACH than it would have been while attending the same lecture live, and 78% of students appreciated the ability to view and review course lectures on their own schedule.",na,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.2002.tb00703.x,666

The students participating in this study were separated randomly but in such a manner that prior achievement was statistically equivalent for the two groups. After approximately two weeks of instruction, an ultrasound imaging exam was administered. indicated no statistically significant difference in scores on homework assigned during the instructional period between the traditional and online groups. Similarly, there was no statistically significant difference in the average exam scores of students in the two groups. The traditional group required significantly more time on learning activities than did the online group. These results indicated that level of understanding was not affected by use of the online device, while efficiency of learning improved dramatically. Reasons reported by the students for the improved efficiency of the online method included flexibility in time usage and ability to cater to the individual, which came with the added responsibility of self-discipline. The traditional teaching method, meanwhile, allowed interaction with and instant feedback from a professor and other students. In this study we have demonstrated that the nature of an online device yields a higher level of efficiency than traditional lectures, despite the inherent drawbacks of the approach. The effectiveness of this device could potentially be improved by implementing enhancements to increase the level of interaction for the user and to help with discipline and time management.",na,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.2002.tb00704.x,667

One approach to fostering this perspective among engineering students is the inclusion of socially relevant design projects throughout the curriculum. In this paper we present an example of one such project used in the introduction to engineering course at Smith College (the largest women's college in the U.S.) in which students are challenged to design toys that introduce children to the principles that underlie technology (TOYtech, or Teaching Our Youth Technology). Based on student surveys, we found that the majority of the course learning objectives were achieved through the implementation of the project, with students emphasizing that the project taught them about the importance of working well in teams and of considering the societal impact of engineering practice. In addition, we present our findings regarding the psychological type distribution of our inaugural class of first-year engineering students and compare these to national values for female engineering students as a whole.

Mechatronics is loosely defined as the application of mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, and computer intelligence to the design of products or systems. By its nature, mechatronics is an activity-oriented course. The course content also provides an opportunity to employ interdisciplinary collaborative learning with active learning techniques. The mechatronics course at Bucknell consists of mechanical and electrical engineering students at the senior and graduate levels. The students engage in a variety of activities in teams comprised of members from each of these groups. In addition to team laboratory exercises and homework assignments, the students work in interdisciplinary groups to process their efforts. That is, they engage in meaningful discussion among themselves concerning their activities and the implications of the various results. The students also act as teachers by preparing lectures and exercises on topics from their discipline to the students in the cross discipline. Specifically, the electrical engineers teach the mechanical engineers microcontrollers, and the mechanical engineers teach the electrical engineers mechanisms. This paper describes the learning techniques employed in this course, as well as the interpretation of the results from the students.

Since Iowa State University (ISU) pioneered the idea of remote SEM for education, researchers have learned that providing teachers access to sophisticated equipment does not ensure that it will be used. Teachers are busy, and structured curriculums are not conducive for incorporating the SEM into classes. A lack of teacher knowledge of SEMs also discourages their use. To overcome these problems, College of Engineering and College of Education faculty are working together to train future teachers in the SEM. The web-based SEM is being used in education courses, and selected students (who receive additional training) prepare lesson plans and present their work to the class.

A Collaborative Learning Methodology for Enhanced Comprehension using TEAMThink®,2002,223,229,KAREN PANETTA***CHARLES DORNBUSH***CATHERINE LOOMIS,Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Tufts University***Athenium***Athenium,NA,91,2,"This paper discusses a teaching methodology to improve the retention of lecture material through peer collaboration among students. The methods introduced also help measure a student's comprehension of class material. In addition, the techniques allow the instructor to obtain continuous feedback on areas that students have difficulty grasping. The instructor can also observe students interpretation of concepts and their written communication skills. The entire process was conducted through the Internet using Athenium's TEAMThink® software. The TEAMThink® software is a professional product developed by Athenium and was developed primarily as a training tool for corporations. This is the first time an educational institution has used it as part of the curriculum. The experiences presented here were conducted on an Operating Systems course at Tufts University's Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science consisting of 36 seniors and 4 graduate students and a second year Introduction to Digital Logic Circuits course consisting of 100 undergraduate students. The TEAMThink® learning process features a quiz making and quiz taking game, where students collaborate in teams to create multiple-choice quiz questions which challenge the learning of other students. The experiences reported in this paper discuss the benefits of this approach from the student and the instructor perspectives. The unexpected outcomes such as the feedback provided to the developers of the TEAMThink® software are also discussed.",na,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.2002.tb00695.x,690

Central to these innovations is a facility at WPI known as the Discovery Classroom. In this facility the traditional lecture hall has been redefined to combine a multi-media classroom, an adjoining experimental laboratory, and computational facilities. This approach was designated as the DIANE philosophy: Daily Integration of Analytical, Numerical, and Experimental methods into engineering classes. In this approach, experimental apparatus are demonstrated directly in class during an engineering lecture. Real-time quantitative data are acquired from the apparatus, and the data are immediately analyzed and compared to concurrently developed theory by the students in class. One objective of this approach is to help students better understand relationships between the physical experiments and theory. Three undergraduate engineering classes were re-designed: fluid mechanics, heat transfer, and aerodynamics. Student surveys indicate that nearly 90% of 390 students preferred the re-designed courses to traditional lecture-oriented courses, while also believing that they gained a better understanding of engineering fundamentals.",na,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.2002.tb00697.x,692

Olin College of Engineering***Institute of Robotics and Mechatronics DLR Research Center Oberpfaffenhofen***Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering Vanderbilt University,NA,91,1,"This work investigates the efficacy of software simulations of electronic circuits laboratories to support beginning electrical engineering students. Experiment 1 was a formative evaluation of an Electronic Laboratory Simulator (ELS), as an optional add-on to physical labs for 120 subjects at four universities. All subjects received the same treatment: their normal classes and physical labs, with optional use of simulated labs. Subjects took written tests specific to the lab's content, before and after using each simulated lab. Only subjects who took both pre- and post-tests were included. Pre- and post-test comparisons indicated significant improvement in both theory and lab knowledge when scores for all labs were combined, but inconsistent performance on individual labs. As the treatment included other learning opportunities in addition to simulated labs, the results were not attributed to the simulations, but provided initial indications and qualitative data on subjects' experiences. These helped to improve the labs and the implementation strategies. Experiment 2 used 40 college sophomores in a beginning electronic circuits lab. Physical lab subjects received seven physical labs. Combined lab subjects received a combination of seven simulated labs and two physical labs. The latter repeated two of the simulated labs to provide physical lab practice. Both treatments used the same assignments. Learner outcome measures were: (a) time required to complete a new criterion physical lab; (b) score on written lab and theory tests over all the labs; and (c) comments on the lab experience. The group that used combined simulated and physical labs performed significantly better on the written tests than the group using entirely physical labs.

However, student preparation is rarely treated as an integral part of course design. Consequently, web-based readiness assessment quizzes were developed for three courses in biological/biosystems engineering, at the freshman and junior levels. The overall goal was to improve student preparatory reading by assessing lower-level knowledge just prior to the class period when that knowledge is needed for higher-level learning activities. In this way, a web-based educational tool was utilized as an integral, rather than just supplemental, part of the course design. The quizzes were designed to simultaneously ensure/assess student preparation and guide the students toward the highest priority topics within a given unit.

The Challenge to Change: On Realizing the New Paradigm for Engineering Education,2003,181,187,Frank G. Splitt,Northwestern University McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science,NA,92,2,"The new paradigm for engineering education goes beyond the need to keep students at the cutting edge of technology and calls for a better balance in the various areas of engineering school scholarship. There is considerable concern that perpetuation of the old paradigm by engineering schools will all but assure minor roles for engineers in the future as well as difficulty in adapting to the exigencies of the fast-paced global marketplace. However, the transition from the old to the new paradigm will not be easy since many of our research-intensive universities are faced with financial pressures while the wherewithal to make the change rests mostly with those who oppose the change in the first place. This situation, coupled with the fact that there is no “one-size-fits-all” transition paradigm, represents the challenge to change. Still, a number of engineering schools have made significant changes and have developed innovative approaches in their undergraduate programs. Taken together, the proven methodologies and knowledge gained should make it possible for most engineering schools to devise revitalization programs that fit the context of their institution, its student body, faculty, and objectives.

Its goals are to (1) overview the accreditation process and clarify the confusing array of terms associated with it (objectives, outcomes, outcome indicators, etc.); (2) provide guidance on the formulation of course learning objectives and assessment methods that address Outcomes 3a-3k; (3) identify and describe instructional techniques that should effectively prepare students to achieve those outcomes by the time they graduate; and (4) propose a strategy for integrating program-level and course-level activities when designing an instructional program to meet the requirements of the ABET engineering criteria.",na,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.2003.tb00734.x,751

The paucity of substantial evidence supporting the value of multimedia as an educational enhancement can at least partially be attributed to definitional problems within experimental designs.

Two questions arise: is the best setting in which to teach this type of material either a combination of lecture and laboratory or all-laboratory; and does a student-owned laptop computer contribute more to learning? For two years the course was organized with these two different modes of instruction. For a third year the students learned in the all-laboratory environment and 30 percent of the students used their own laptop computer. At the end of the semester an in-depth questionnaire with quantitative ratings was given to the students to determine if there were differences in their learning preferences. Contingency tables were used to compare responses. There were several statistically significant differences in student responses favoring the all-laboratory mode and students using laptop computers.

Two changes to WIE programs are suggested to reduce Type III spotlighting: (1) offer their benefits either to all students or based on academic, not demographic, criteria, and (2) expand WIE programs to “conduct in engineering” programs that would emphasize pre-emption of non-professional behavior, and would be more inclusive of other biases.",gender***spotlighting***women in engineering,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.2005.tb00865.x,809

Even before they study engineering ethics, students put honesty and integrity on par with technical competence as an essential characteristic of engineers. In the course, students benefit from cases of actual incidents and from classroom activities that encourage diverse perspectives on moral problems.

Cognitive variables included high school rank, SAT scores, and university cumulative grade point average. Noncognitive factors included academic motivation and institutional integration. Outcome variables included grade point average, enrollment at the university, and status as an engineering major. Gender differences also were evaluated. Several significant relationships among the variables were found. For instance, increased levels of motivation were significantly related to continuing in the major.

Data collection consisted of focus groups with students and one-on-one interviews with instructors and industry cooperators. The findings yielded authentic understandings of teaching and learning engineering design, many areas of common perceptions between participant groups, congruence with design concepts in the literature, and areas where students' perceptions and experiences did not correspond to instructors' intentions. Teaching implications include the importance of instructors' transparency and integration in teaching and the need to explicitly prepare students for a different kind of learning experience in the Design Trilogy.",design***qualitative research***course trilogy,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.2005.tb00853.x,818

Therefore, many university engineering courses require students to work in groups to complete a design project. Due to the increasingly global nature of engineering, opportunities for students to navigate the issues of distance, time, culture, language, and multiple perspectives associated with virtual teams are becoming particularly desirable. To understand students' experience with virtual teams in a graduate course on principles of lean manufacturing, a group of researchers at a midwestern university compared the project performance, selected group processes, and satisfaction of students randomly assigned to face-to-face and computer-mediated communication design teams. Students in both the face-to-face and computer-mediated communication design teams performed equally well on the final project, and reported similar patterns in group processes with a few exceptions.

Student Assessment Precision in Mechanical Engineering Courses,2005,273,278,Sheldon I. Green,Department of Mechanical Engineering University of British Columbia,NA,94,2,"Student performance on mid-term quizzes and final examinations was compared for several core undergraduate courses. A statistical comparison of the grades of students on these two tests showed only a modest correlation between grades. The modest correlation may be attributed to several factors: inaccurate grading of examinations, differences in the material tested on the mid-terms and finals, and sampling error due to the small numbers of questions on examinations. Evidence is presented that sampling error is the primary source of the low correlations. In practice, the modest correlations of mid-term quiz and final examination grades imply that the grades assigned to students are some aggregate of a true measure of the ability of students and randomness. The randomness arises because the instructor selects a particular subset of the course material for examination, not complete coverage of the course by question of all levels of difficulty.",na,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.2005.tb00848.x,836

Integrated curricula have connections to a larger movement in higher education—learning communities, which help learners to build interdisciplinary links and social links within a community. Integrated engineering curricula have provided concrete assessment data on retention and student performance to augment research on learning communities. While innovators in both movements have offered many prototypes and gathered many data, goals and results from programs implemented to date are not sufficiently well defined to guide the design and implementation of programs at other institutions.

However, by the 1980s, the accreditation criteria had become increasingly prescriptive, inhibiting development of innovative programs to reflect changing needs of practice. In response, ABET (formerly Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology) and its stakeholders developed revised criteria, Engineering Criteria 2000 (EC2000), which emphasize learning outcomes, assessment, and continuous improvement rather than detailed curricular specifications. These criteria, together with international agreements among engineering accrediting bodies, facilitate mobility of an increasingly global profession. To assess the utility of the new criteria, ABET has commissioned a multiyear study of the impact of EC2000 on U.S. engineering education. Initial results from the study are encouraging and, as more results emerge, should support continuous improvement of the accreditation process, itself.",accreditation***Engineering Criteria 2000***global profession,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.2005.tb00836.x,851

We first identify CSEd as a research field in which no shared paradigm exists, and then we describe the Bootstrapping project, its metaphor, structure, rationale, and delivery, as designed to create a community of practice of CSEd researchers. Features of other projects are also outlined that have similar aims of capacity building in disciplinary-specific pedagogic enquiry. A theoretically derived framework for evaluating the success of endeavours of this type is then presented, and we report the results from an empirical study. We conclude with four open questions for our project and others like it: Where is the locus of a community of practice? Who are the core members?

We achieved inter-reader reliability by beginning each assessment with a calibrated reading and by adjudicating non-adjacent scores. After using the model successfully for three semesters, we can see increased consistency in teaching among sections and semesters, more communication among instructors, and we are beginning a database with which we can test further change.

The performances of participants running the simulation with the manual history mode were significantly better than users running the simulation with the automatic history mode. Moreover, the effects of using the history mechanism with the ability to undo further enhanced the learning process. The findings imply that students' decision when to record the history during their engineering training process can have a particularly strong enhancing effect on learning.

The approach featured a market game that engaged a pilot group of 20 students in forming IT companies and competing for the best design of a travel agent system. The rest of the students in the course completed the traditional class project, which involved designing and building a land sailer. A pre-post Likert-type survey designed to measure students' perceptions of the engineering profession was administered to all students enrolled in this course. In addition, a short answer questionnaire seeking students' pedagogical perceptions of the market game and the land sailer project was administered at the end of the course. indicated that students' overall perceptions of the engineering profession significantly improved by the end of the course. More importantly, the results indicated that students who participated in the market game had significantly better perceptions of engineering entrepreneurship, specifically professional skills, than students who participated in the land sailer project.

Post-test data showed that younger students achieved parity with the more advanced students in basic scientific knowledge. The younger students also became highly adaptive by the post-test, but the older students did not advance beyond their pre-curriculum levels.

This article proposes that the two sides are debating different propositions: whether research can support teaching in principle and whether it has been shown to do so in practice. The article reviews the literature on the current state of the research-teaching nexus and then examines three specific strategies for integrating teaching and scholarship: bringing research into the classroom, involving undergraduates in research projects, and broadening the definition of scholarship beyond frontier disciplinary research.

To investigate this success, we adopted an ethnographic perspective, interviewing 185 students who represented four fields and four institutions as well as 12 faculty in Industrial Engineering at the University of Oklahoma. These data pointed to a combination of aspects of the discipline and the department culture as explanatory variables. Emerging from the data was a third explanatory variable: a high number of students, disproportionately many women, who relocated into Industrial Engineering from another major, underscoring the impact of broad recruiting activities.

The method of content analysis was used to analyze the language used by engineering undergraduate students, and to extract the underlying common factors or perceived characteristics of “Excellence in Engineering Education.” These common factors were then used to identify and compare the similarities and differences in views between engineering students and perspectives from three types of stakeholders in the field. Forty-seven undergraduate engineering students (17 females and 30 males) participated voluntarily in this study to answer four individual questions and ten group questions. The results showed that students strongly emphasized the importance of their own roles in the educational system and the value of instructional technology and real work examples in enhancing the quality of engineering education.

Conceptual Difficulties Experienced by Trained Engineers Learning Educational Research Methods,2007,91,102,Maura Borrego,Department of Engineering Education Virginia Tech,NA,96,2,"This paper describes conceptual difficulties that may be experienced by engineering faculty as they become engineering education researchers. Observation, survey, and assessment data collected at the 2005 NSF-funded Rigorous Research in Engineering Education workshop were systematically analyzed to uncover the five difficulties encountered by engineering faculty learning to design rigorous education studies: (1) framing research questions with broad appeal, (2) grounding research in a theoretical framework, (3) fully considering operationalization and measurement of constructs, (4) appreciating qualitative or mixed-methods approaches, and (5) pursuing interdisciplinary collaboration. The first four can be understood in terms of disciplinary consensus; they represent explicit steps in education research that are implicit in technical engineering research because there is greater consensus of methods and standards. This work better frames the issue of rigor in engineering education research by clarifying the fundamental differences that prevent application of traditional engineering standards of rigor directly to engineering education research.",education research***graduate programs***rigorous research,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.2007.tb00920.x,915

Current calls within the engineering education community for increased rigor can be understood in terms of the ways similar disciplines have emerged. In science education, for example, time was needed to develop consensus on important research questions, accepted methods, and standards of rigor. The abstracts of 700 publications listed on active engineering education coalition Web sites were analyzed over time by type of intervention, population of focus, and product. A picture consistent with other reports of coalition contributions emerged. Early focus was on freshman courses and integrating across disciplines, with teamwork, design and other active learning activities.

Although the pipeline model has supported several types of interventions, the mental model oversimplifies complexities of the underlying processes, focuses interventions at points of unwanted leakage, and suggests that leaks need to be plugged instead of systems renewed. Analysis suggests that even if leak-stopping interventions could be multiplied through significant increases in funding, they would remain insufficient to attain the goal of having student enrollments in engineering substantially reflect the demographics of the general population.

Correlations between answer selection and explanation as found from coding suggested that a reasonable guess as to a student's thinking can be made based on the answer choice alone.

Data from the National Survey of Student Engagement show that this similarity extends to engagement outcomes including course challenge, faculty interaction, satisfaction with institution, and overall satisfaction. Engineering differs from other majors most notably by a dearth of female students and a low rate of migration into the major. Noting the similarity of students of engineering and other majors with respect to persistence and engagement, we propose that engagement is a precursor to persistence. We explore this hypothesis using data from the Academic Pathways Study of the Center for the Advancement of Engineering Education. Further exploration reveals that although persistence and engagement do not vary as much as expected by discipline, there is significant institutional variation, and we assert a need to address persistence and engagement at the institutional level and throughout higher education. Finally, our findings highlight the potential of making the study of engineering more attractive to qualified students. Our findings suggest that a two-pronged approach holds the greatest potential for increasing the number of students graduating with engineering degrees: identify programming that retains the students who come to college committed to an engineering major, and develop programming and policies that allow other students to migrate in. There is already considerable discourse on persistence, so our findings suggest that more research focus is needed on the pathways into engineering, including pathways from other majors.",engagement***persistence***migration,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.2008.tb00978.x,949

The statistical analysis reveals that college students in general agree that engineering is beneficial to the society; however, they tend to believe that it takes too much effort to gain an engineering degree and that engineering is a demanding career. Further, they are neutral about the personal benefits of pursuing a degree in engineering, and finally, they do not feel that studying engineering or making engineering as their profession is particularly interesting.

The most common measure of reliability, coefficient alpha, is frequently used without an understanding of its behavior. This article contributes to the understanding of test reliability by demonstrating that questions which lower reliability are inconsistent with the bulk of the test, being prone to test-taking tricks and guessing. These qualitative characteristics, obtained from focus groups, provide possible causes of lower reliability such as poorly written questions (e.g., the correct answer looks different from the incorrect answers), questions where students must guess (e.g., the topic is too advanced), and questions where recalling a definition is crucial. Quantitative findings confirm that questions lower reliability when students who answer correctly have lower overall scores than students who answer incorrectly. This phenomenon is quantified by the “gap” between these students' overall scores, which is shown to be highly correlated with other item metrics. An increasing number of concept inventory tests are being developed to assess student learning in engineering.

Universalized Narratives: Patterns in How Faculty Members Define “Engineering”,2009,309,319,Alice L. Pawley,Purdue University,NA,98,4,"U.S. engineering educators are discussing how we define engineering to ourselves and to others, such as in the recently released U.S. National Academy of Engineering (NAE) report, Changing the Conversation. In these conversations, leaders have proposed the skills, knowledge, processes, values, and attitudes that should define engineering. However, little attention has been paid to the daily work of engineering faculty, through their engineering research and teaching students to be new engineers, that puts these discipline-defining ideas into practice in academia. (Hypothesis) The different types of narratives engineering faculty explicitly or implicitly use to describe engineering are categorized. Categorizing these common narratives can help inform the nationwide conversation about whether these are the best narratives to tell in order to attract a diverse population of future engineers. Interviews with ten engineering faculty at a research-extensive university were conducted. Interview transcripts were coded thematically through coarse then fine coding passes. The coarse codes were drawn from boundary theory; the fine codes emerged from the data. Faculty members' descriptions moved within and among the narratives of engineering as applied science and math, as problem-solving, and as making things. The narratives are termed “universalized” because of their broad-sweeping discursive application within and across participants' interviews. s These narratives drawn from academic engineers' practice put engineering at odds with recommendations from the NAE report. However, naming the narratives helps make them visible so we may then develop and practice telling contrasting narratives to future and current engineering students.",discourse analysis***engineering epistemology***faculty work,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.2009.tb01029.x,984
Study of Usage Patterns and Learning Gains in a Web-based Interactive Static Course,2009,321,333,Paul S. Steif***Anna Dollár,Carnegie Mellon University***Miami University,NA,98,4,"Courseware for engineering education can feature many discrete interactive learning elements, and typically student usage is not compelled. To take advantage of such courseware, self-regulation of learning may be necessary. Evaluation of courseware should consider actual usage, learning gains, and indications of learning self-regulation. (Hypothesis) The research question focuses on how students' interactions with the courseware affect their learning gains. The hypothesis tested is that learning gains from online courseware increase with usage, and particularly with usage that suggests learning self-regulation. Students in a lecture-based statics course were assigned to study previously developed courseware as part of homework assignments. Learning gains were deduced from pre- and post- paper and pencil diagnostic quizzes, and from the first class exam. Credit was based on quiz scores, rather than courseware usage. Usage of interactive elements of the courseware was inferred from log files of students' interactions with the courseware, and patterns suggesting learning self-regulation were identified. High, statistically significant learning gains were found. Substantial usage was evident, with core learning activities initiated by, on average, three-quarters of students. Learning gains and performance on the relevant class exam appeared to be more closely correlated with usage that indicated self-regulation of learning rather than with total usage of the courseware. s of assessing courseware should go beyond courseware features, learning gains, and student self-reports of effectiveness to include monitoring of actual usage and analyses relating usage to learning. Self-regulation of learning is likely to be critical to successful usage of courseware, and courseware should be designed to encourage it.",courseware***online learning***statics,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.2009.tb01030.x,985

Applied ethics is currently a required component of the pre-practice education for these professions, yet the literature suggests that challenges remain in how we define, instruct, and assess professions-based ethics education. Based on the on going debate associated with the instruction and assessment of applied engineering ethics, an exploratory investigation was performed to determine what could be learned by looking across professions. Scope/Method Ethics, as an educational topic, can be very broad in scope. This study was limited to literature at the intersection of ethics terminology, historical development, instruction, and assessment within engineering, health, business, and law. Many references associated with each profession and the input of profession-specific content experts informed the literature survey. s Ethics within the engineering, health, business, and law professions have historically developed in isolation. Even case studies, which the engineering profession seems to have adopted from law, are framed differently within engineering. There are common lines of debate related to instructional methods, curricular methods, and instructor qualifications, but no profession has resolved these debates. A common trend in applied ethics research is a focus on assessment of student learning, rather than evaluation of instructional methods and/or curriculum incorporation methods. Assessment tools have been developed and applied widely for many years in several of the health care sub-disciplines, business and law.

As such, these test results are sometimes used beyond their intended scope to predict student academic success. (Hypothesis) This study evaluated relationships between TOEFL scores and several measures of academic success for students at an American university abroad. Characterizing these relationships helps assess the scope of the TOEFL score's use in admissions decision making. Linear and logistic regression were used to evaluate TOEFL score relative to overall grade point average (GPA), GPA for courses in engineering and in humanities, rate of passing a Comprehensive Assessment Examination (CAE), and graduation rate. High school GPA, gender, and nationality were also included as independent variables. A positive, statistically significant relationship was identified between TOEFL score and GPA, although weaker for engineering students than students in other fields, and for engineering courses than non-engineering courses. TOEFL score was also statistically significant in logistic regressions of CAE pass rate and graduation rate, indicating increasing probability of success with increasing TOEFL score. However, model goodness-of-fit measures were relatively low, indicating many students whose performance defies general trends. s In spite of correlations between TOEFL score and academic performance, TOEFL scores should not be used in admissions beyond assessing individual students' English proficiency.

Specifically, we analyzed data from the Managerial Behavior Instrument, completed by 81 engineering students who participated in self-managed teams for one semester. The instrument measured the use of the four leadership profiles of the Competing Values Framework which then allowed the researcher to determine the presence of high or low behavioral complexity. Behavioral complexity determines the team's ability to utilize multiple leadership roles and subsequent effectiveness. The findings indicate that behavioral complexity does have a significant effect on performance but does not have a significant effect on the attitudes of team members. Overall, teams with high behavioral complexity earned a higher grade on their final team project than teams with low behavioral complexity. This study is significant for engineering education because it provides a theory and framework for understanding leadership in teams. By exploring the relationship between leadership in SMTs and effectiveness, educators and industry can better understand the type of leadership roles necessary for achieving a highly effective team.

However, engineering majors reported significantly higher gains in practical competence and higher order thinking, but the lowest means on reflective learning and gains in general education. Engineering majors reported significantly more time preparing for class and less time participating in educationally enriching experiences. s We conclude that different educational outcomes between majors are the result of programmatic differences.

Content analysis was performed on 130 funded proposals from the U.S. National Science Foundation's Integrative Graduate Education and Research Traineeship (IGERT) program. Four desired student learning outcomes were identified: contributions to the technical area, broad perspective, teamwork, and interdisciplinary communication skills. Student requirements (educational plans) addressed these outcomes to some extent, but assessment/evidence sections generally targeted program level goals—as opposed to student learning. This lack of constructive alignment between components is a major weakness of graduate curriculum. s Current practices are promising. Further clarification of interdisciplinary learning outcomes, coupled with closer alignment of outcomes, evidence, and learning experiences will continue to improve interdisciplinary graduate education in engineering and science.

Weak correlation was found in the five UON algorithm's assumptions: students complete assigned work, teaching assistants can grade MEAs accurately, accurate feedback in peer review is perceived by the reviewed team as being more helpful than inaccurate feedback, teaching assistant scores on the first draft of an MEA can be used to accurately predict where teams will need assistance on their second draft, and the error a peer review has in evaluating a sample MEA solution is an accurate indicator of the error they will have while subsequently evaluating a real team's MEA solution. s Conducting informed peer review matching requires significant alignment between evaluators and experts to minimize deviations from the algorithm's designed purpose.",calibration***model-eliciting activity***peer-review,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.2010.tb01070.x,1027

(Hypothesis) The primary purpose was to develop a statistically reliable survey instrument to document teachers' beliefs and expectations about pre-college engineering instruction, college preparation, and career success in engineering, called the Engineering Education Beliefs and Expectations Instrument (EEBEI), and to compare teachers' views. Using two samples of teachers, EEBEI was established as a statistically reliable survey and was used to examine the beliefs and expectations of Project Lead the Way (PLTW) and non-PLTW teachers. The results were used to further examine teachers' decisions in advising fictional students (described in vignettes) with varying academic and socioeconomic profiles. High school STEM teachers report their instruction was influenced by students' interests, family background, and prior academic achievement. Comparisons between PLTW and non-PLTW teachers revealed that non-PLTW teachers agreed more strongly that an engineer must demonstrate high scholastic achievement in math and science whereas PLTW teachers were more likely to report that science and math content was integrated into engineering activities. Although teachers report that students' socioeconomic status was not influential when asked explicitly, it did influence situated decision-making tasks using fictional student vignettes. s Findings address challenges of STEM integration and reveal conflicting purposes of K-12 engineering education as being for a select few or to promote technological literacy for all students, which affects recruitment, instruction, and assessment practices.",K-12 engineering education***STEM***teacher beliefs,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.2010.tb01071.x,1028

To provide a successful learning experience for students engaged in writing activities, timely feedback is necessary. Providing this feedback to increasing numbers of students poses a major challenge for instructors. New automated systems work towards providing both timely and appropriate writing feedback, but students' views on automated feedback, and feedback in general, are not well understood. (Hypothesis) To contribute to a deeper understanding of students' conceptions of feedback from tutors and an automated system called Glosser, and how these conceptions are related to achievement. Students in an engineering course worked in pairs to write an engineering report on e-business. The design of the study involves in-depth interviews and the analysis employs an approach in which student conceptions of automated feedback are investigated in relation to related feedback from their tutor, perceptions of automated feedback in general, and their academic achievement. Students' conceptions of feedback vary and can be grouped into cohesive and fragmented, which is consistent with other theoretical models. Close associations were found between more cohesive conceptions of feedback and better academic performance. s A student's conception of traditional and automated feedback is similar, being either cohesive or fragmented.

(Hypothesis) Research questions include: How widespread is awareness and adoption of established engineering education innovations? Are there differences by discipline or institutional type? How do engineering department chairs find out about engineering education innovations? What factors do engineering department chairs cite as important in adoption decisions? U.S. engineering department chairs were surveyed regarding their awareness and department use of seven engineering education innovations. One hundred ninety-seven usable responses are presented primarily as categorical data with Chi square tests where relevant. Overall, the awareness rate was 82 percent, while the adoption rate was 47 percent. Eighty-two percent of engineering departments employ student-active pedagogies (the highest). Mechanical and civil engineering had the highest rates, in part due to many design-related innovations in the survey. Few differences by institution type were evident. In the past, word of mouth and presentations were far more effective than publications in alerting department chairs to the innovations.

(Hypothesis) This study uses an integrated model leveraging the strengths of multiple statistical techniques to analyze the educational process from pre-high school through college and predict which students will achieve a STEM education. The probability of earning a STEM degree is modeled using variables available as of the eighth grade as well as standardized test scores from high school. These include demographic, attitudinal, experiential, and academic performance measures derived from the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 (NELS:88) dataset. The integrated model combines logistic regression, survival analysis, and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis to predict whether an individual is likely to obtain a STEM degree. Predicted results of the integrated model were compared to actual outcomes and those of a separate logistic regression model. The modeling process identified a set of significant predictive variables and achieved very good predictive accuracy. The integrated model and logistic regression model performed with comparable precision. s The modeling process was adept at identifying STEM students and a large pool of other degree students that might have been capable of pursuing a STEM degree.

(Hypothesis) The goal of this study was to jointly examine the impact of contextualizing engineering instruction and varying the number of practice opportunities on pre-college students' learning and learning perceptions. Using a 3 × 2 factorial design, students were randomly assigned to learn about electrical circuit analysis with an instructional program that represented problems in abstract, contextualized, or both forms, either with two practice problems or four practice problems. The abstract problems were devoid of any real-life context and represented with standard abstract electrical circuit diagrams. The contextualized problems were anchored around real-life scenarios and represented with life-like images. The combined contextualized-abstract condition added abstract circuit diagrams to the contextualized representation. To measure learning, students were given a problem-solving near-transfer post-test. Learning perceptions were measured using a program-rating survey where students had to rate the instructional program's diagrams, helpfulness, and difficulty. Students in the combined contextualized-abstract condition scored higher on the post-test, produced better problem representations, and rated the program's diagrams and helpfulness higher than their counterparts. Students who were given two practice problems gave higher program diagram and helpfulness ratings than those given four practice problems. s These findings suggest that pre-college engineering instruction should consider anchoring learning in real-life contexts and providing students with abstract problem representations that can be transferred to a variety of problems.",practice***problem representation***problem solving,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.2010.tb01058.x,1033

While many researchers provide descriptions and suggestions that engagement is crucial to learning, there is no widespread, standard definition for engagement to guide engineering educators. (Hypothesis) The purpose of this study is to begin to understand student engagement by examining how students and faculty viewed the term engagement as it relates to their engineering courses. The two key questions asked were (1) How do faculty and undergraduate students define engagement? and (2) How are their definitions similar or different? This exploratory study included a survey of all engineering faculty teaching first- and second-year students and first- and second-year engineering undergraduates enrolled in any engineering course within the standard curriculum at a small engineering school. Students view engagement in terms of faculty enthusiasm for the subject and in teaching and the availability of faculty for out-of-class interactions. Faculty members believe that engagement rests with the students. s This study suggests that there is not a single definition of engagement for engineering students. Rather, engagement is both a process and an outcome.

Some studies that examine graduate engineering education suggest that students are experiencing educational deficiencies that can affect the research experience. Thus, exploring engineering graduate student research proficiency is warranted. (Hypothesis) This work begins to earnestly answer the research questions “How proficient are engineering graduate students in research?” and “What factors affect the research proficiency of these students?” In order to answer the two research questions specifically for the Georgia Institute of Technology Environmental Engineering graduate program, current students in the program participated in two surveys. Survey questions were designed to measure students' perceptions of their research proficiency and to aid in determining student academic motivations tied to proficiency. Many students indicated that they lacked research preparation upon beginning graduate study and during the first year of study, lacked development in important research skills like statistics and communicating in writing, and were somewhat hindered in research organization and progress. Regarding academic motivations, students generally valued personal advancement and enrichment over paper publication. Doctoral students overall indicated more preparation with respect to several aspects of research and more value placed on paper publication than did master's students. s The surveys provided important findings regarding student research proficiency for the engineering graduate program in question.

The research question addresses whether students can be induced to think about the bodies present, and whether focusing on bodies improves problem solving performance. Using a pre-post test design, written and verbal protocols were obtained for students solving problems before and after instruction. During instruction all students saw the same set of examples and corrected answers, but only the experimental group was asked questions designed to promote body centered talk. Solutions and protocols were coded and analyzed for frequency of body centered talk and solution quality. The experimental group showed statistically significant increases in relevant body centered talk after instruction. Both groups improved their ability to represent unknown forces in free body diagrams after instruction, with the experimental group showing a greater, but not statistically significant, improvement. However, for both groups, the error rate in representing unknown forces at an interaction was significantly lower when a student referred to the bodies in the particular interaction. s Problem solving in conceptually rich domains can improve if, in addition to acquiring conceptual knowledge, students develop strategies for recognizing when and how to apply it.",concept***metacognition***problem-solving strategy***statics,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.2010.tb01050.x,1041

(Hypothesis) Project Lead the Way (PLTW) provides a pre-college curriculum that focuses on the integration of engineering with science and mathematics. We documented the impact that enrollment in PLTW had on student science and math achievement. We consider the enriched integration hypothesis, which states that students taking PLTW courses will show achievement benefits, after controlling for prior achievement and other student and teacher characteristics. We contrast this with alternative hypotheses that propose little or no impact of the engineering coursework on students' math and science achievement (the insufficient integration hypothesis), or that PLTW enrollment might be negatively associated with student achievement (the adverse integration hypothesis). Using multilevel statistical modeling with students (N = 140) nested within teachers, we report findings from a quantitative analysis of the relationship between PLTW enrollment and student achievement on state standardized tests of math and science. While students gained in math and science achievement overall from eighth to tenth grade, students enrolled in PLTW foundation courses showed significantly smaller math assessment gains than those in a matched group that did not enroll, and no measurable advantages on science assessments, when controlling for prior achievement and teacher experience.

Direct quantification of participation, academic performance assessment based on homework and exam scores, and survey-based assessments of student perceptions of the course were collected. Based on these data, cognitive and affective learning responses to different technological and interaction-based aspects of the course were determined for each course format. We show that while affective learning decreased for students in the distance format course relative to the traditional format, cognitive learning was comparable. Our results suggest that loss of satellite connection and audio losses had a stronger negative effect on student perceptions than video disturbances, and that participation was the most important factor influencing affective learning. s While our findings do not suggest that cognitive learning is strongly affected by social presence, implementing strategies to enhance social presence may improve the overall learning experience and make distance learning more enjoyable for students.",distance learning***participation***social presence,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.2010.tb01039.x,1049

(Hypothesis) We hypothesized that computer-based models that matched young women in terms of their race and gender would be the most effective in positively influencing their interest, self-efficacy, and stereotypes about engineering. Eighty African American undergraduate female students in Experiment 1, and 39 White undergraduate female students in Experiment 2 interacted with a computer-based agent that provided a narrative designed to encourage them to pursue engineering careers. The study employed a 2 × 2 between subjects factorial design (agent gender: male vs. female and agent race: Black vs. White). Across both studies we found that race and gender influenced the effectiveness of the agent for several key outcome measures.

Identification of Dysfunctional Cooperative Learning Teams Based on Students' Academic Achievement,2010,45,54,Chin-Min Hsiung,National Pingtung University of Science and Technology,NA,99,1,"Considerable evidence exists to suggest that students who study cooperatively reap significant benefits in terms of their learning performance. However, sooner or later, most cooperative learning teams have to deal with one or more members whose actions disturb the team. Unless these problems are quickly resolved, the cooperative learning team gradually becomes dysfunctional and the benefits of cooperative learning are diminished. (Hypothesis) A method is proposed for identifying dysfunctional cooperative learning teams by comparing the academic achievement of students in a cooperative learning condition with that of students in an individual learning condition. A series of experiments were performed in which 42 sophomore mechanical engineering students were randomly assigned to the two learning conditions and were formed into mixed-ability groups comprising three team members. The academic performance of the students in the two learning conditions was then systematically compared in terms of their respective test scores. Dysfunctional teams were identified using a new quality index defined as the mean test score of the team divided by the standard deviation of the team members' test scores. The probability of a Type I error was quantified using a control chart. The identification results were verified by analyzing the students' off-task behavior frequency and attitudes toward cooperative learning, respectively. s The experimental results confirm that the proposed quality index is a potential indicator of dysfunctional cooperative learning teams.",academic achievement***cooperative learning***dysfunctional team,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.2010.tb01041.x,1051
Lessons Learned: Implementing the Case Teaching Method in a Mechanical Engineering Course,2010,55,69,Aman Yadav***Gregory M. Shaver***Peter Meckl,Purdue University***Purdue University***Purdue University,NA,99,1,"Case studies have been found to increase students' critical thinking and problem-solving skills, higher-order thinking skills, conceptual change, and their motivation to learn. Despite the popularity of the case study approach within engineering, the empirical research on the effectiveness of case studies is limited and the research that does exist has primarily focused on student perceptions of their learning rather than actual learning outcomes. (Hypothesis) This paper describes an investigation of the impact of case-based instruction on undergraduate mechanical engineering students' conceptual understanding and their attitudes towards the use of case studies. Seventy-three students from two sections of the same mechanical engineering course participated in this study. The two sections were both taught using traditional lecture and case teaching methods. Participants completed pre-tests, post-tests, and a survey to assess their conceptual understanding and engagement. s suggested that the majority of participants felt the use of case studies was engaging and added a lot of realism to the class. There were no significant differences between traditional lecture and case teaching method on students' conceptual understanding. However, the use of case studies did no harm to students' understanding while making the content more relevant to students. s Case-based instruction can be beneficial for students in terms of actively engaging them and allowing them to see the application and/or relevance of engineering to the real world.",case-based instruction***conceptual understanding***mechanical engineering,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.2010.tb01042.x,1052

These impacts were seen particularly in studies regarding cross-curricular portfolios. (Hypothesis) This study was designed to explicitly investigate identity-related impacts of cross-curricular portfolios and to explore the processes students employed during portfolio construction to identify themselves as budding engineers and as future professionals. Design/Mscethod Engineering undergraduate students attended four weekly workshops where they wrote a professional statement, selected artifacts that demonstrated their engineering abilities, and wrote annotations that explained how the artifacts served as concrete examples of their claims for professional standing. Online surveys were administered at each workshop asking participants about their ongoing experiences of creating their portfolios and sharing these portfolios with their peers. Analysis of the survey responses revealed that participants had two primary frames of reference for the construction of professional identity during portfolio creation. The external frame of reference focused on students' understanding of the expectations of potential employers and recruiters. The internal frame of reference, which accounted for twice as many responses as the external frame coding, focused on students' emerging realizations of their own values and interests as professional engineers. s As engineering educators, we often support the external frame of reference in terms of building professional identity.

Can these indicators distinguish between problem solvers in terms of their skill level? How can these indicators be used to improve the effectiveness of instructor feedback to problem-solving exercises? (Hypothesis) Based on the published literature on cognition and problem solving, several indicators were hypothesized to signal knowledge and skill: an accurate free-body diagram, specification of assumptions, accurate expansion of key principles, strategic (forward) inferences, and checking equations and solutions. A mixed experimental methodology was applied that combined qualitative and quantitative analyses. The qualitative data was comprised of paper-and-pencil solutions and video recordings of participants while they solved problems. Frequency counts of skill indicators and grader-assigned scores comprised the quantitative data. Statistical tests confirmed that the hypothesized indicators were associated with individuals' level of skill. However, reliable evidence for these indicators was only partially found in the paper-and-pencil solutions and could only be firmly established by including data from the video recordings. The results show that paper-and-pencil solutions can be diagnostic of the strengths and weaknesses of problem-solvers.

(Hypothesis) 1. How do students' perceptions of the nature of cognition, experimental design, and ambiguity compare across selected virtual and physical laboratory experiences? 2. In what ways do students perceive the virtual and physical laboratories as an authentic experience that is reflective of real-life engineering? Three, free-response survey questions were quantitatively and qualitatively analyzed. Content analysis was used to establish categories to group the responses, and the coding process had an interrater reliability of 0.90. Student responses showed statistically significant increases in categories of Experimental Design, Critical Thinking, and Ambiguity in the virtual laboratories and in Lab Protocol and Specific Content in the physical laboratories. Additionally, more overall High Cognition statements were observed in the virtual laboratory. Student perceptions of ambiguity shifted from ambiguity in the instruction to an ambiguity in the experimental process itself, and many students were able to suspend disbelief in the virtual laboratories and demonstrated psychological presence, leading to the potential for a rich learning experience. The industrially situated virtual laboratories reported in this paper provide affordances for substantially different student thinking about their thinking than the physical laboratories in the same course. This conclusion does not suggest that the differences are a direct result of the medium of the laboratory (virtual vs. physical) but rather the opportunities that the instructional design of each type of laboratory affords.",cognitive apprenticeship***metacognition***virtual laboratory,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.2011.tb00026.x,1071
The Design and Experimental Evaluation of a Scaffolded Software Environment to Improve Engineering Students' Disciplinary Problem-Solving Skills,2011,574,603,Christopher Hundhausen***Pawan Agarwal***Richard Zollars***Adam Carter,Washington State University***Washington State University***Washington State University***Washington State University,NA,100,3,"Introductory gateway engineering courses are notorious for their high attrition rates. Deficiencies in students' problem-solving processes may contribute to their failure in these courses. In an empirical study of student problem solving, we observed that students struggle because of misconceptions regarding the basic syntax and semantics of disciplinary diagrams and corresponding mathematical equations. (Hypothesis) We hypothesize that a scaffolded software environment that provides dynamically-generated feedback on the syntactic and semantic correctness of students' evolving disciplinary diagrams and mathematical equations can improve engineering students' problem-solving abilities. We iteratively developed ChemProV, a software environment to assist chemical engineering students in solving material balance problems. To evaluate ChemProV's effectiveness, we performed two between subjects experimental studies. The first study compared a preliminary version of the ChemProV to pen-and-paper. The second study compared a redesigned version of ChemProV with dynamic feedback to the same version of ChemProV without dynamic feedback. While it did not uncover any significant differences, the first study provided insight into how to improve ChemProV's dynamic feedback mechanism. The second study found that the “feedback” version of ChemProV promoted a statistically-significant advantage in problem-solving accuracy, significantly more time-on-task, and a transfer-of-training to an unscaffolded problem-solving situation. A scaffolded software environment like ChemProV can serve as a valuable aid in helping students learn engineering problem-solving skills. Its software design approach can be used as a model for designing educationally-effective software environments for other engineering disciplines.",problem solving***software scaffolding***visualization,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.2011.tb00027.x,1072
Pre-Collegiate Factors Influencing the Self-Efficacy of Engineering Students,2011,604,623,Todd D. Fantz***Thomas J. Siller***Michael A. Demiranda,Old Dominion University***Colorado State University***Colorado State University,NA,100,3,"Many engineering colleges have the goal of increasing the quality and number of students choosing to pursue engineering and therefore are heavily invested in programs that expose pre-collegiate students to engineering. Most commonly, these institutions are involved with summer outreach programs and weekend or fieldtrip opportunities for students to visit engineering campuses, and some curriculum development. A lesser, often untapped resource for engineering colleges is through K-12 technology and pre-engineering teacher training. (Hypothesis) This study addresses the long term effects of pre-collegiate engineering experiences on student selfefficacy. It is hypothesized that the greater the rigor of a pre-colligate experience, the more it will contribute to a student's self-efficacy related to engineering studies. The pre-collegiate experiences examined in this study include pre-engineering classes, multi-day programs, engineering hobbies, working in an engineering environment, extra-curricular engineering programs, and single-day field trips. The long term effects of pre-collegiate experiences were evaluated by comparing the self-efficacy of firstyear students who had the experiences to first-year students who did not have the experiences. Significant differences in self-efficacy were only found between groups of students who had pre-engineering classes and engineering hobbies versus students who did not have these experiences. Based on the findings, engineering colleges with the goal of increasing the self-efficacy of engineering students should consider focusing resources on developing K-12 technology and pre-engineering teachers.

(Hypothesis) While earlier work found that women in nearly all racial groups persist to the eighth semester at rates comparable to men, results vary in studies that use other measures of success, providing an incentive to compare multiple measures of success in the same population. The eight-semester persistence and six-year graduation rates are compared for various race-gender populations using a longitudinal, comprehensive dataset of more than 75,000 students matriculating in engineering at nine universities from 1988–1998. Gender differences in persistence of Asian, Black, Hispanic, Native American, and White students are far outweighed by institutional differences. Racial differences are more pronounced, however, revealing some patterns that transcend institutional differences. Our work demonstrates that trajectories of persistence are non-linear, gendered, and racialized, and further that higher education has developed the way in which persistence is studied based on the behavior of the majority, specifically the White, male population. Even if institutions were to treat all students equally, the outcomes will not necessarily be the same because various populations respond differently to the same conditions. Using eight-semester persistence may result in a “systematic majority measurement bias.” Therefore, multiple measures may be needed to describe outcomes in diverse populations.",gender***race***student success,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.2011.tb00012.x,1077

Bunting,Purdue University***American Institutes for Research***University of Wisconsin-River Falls***Oklahoma State University,NA,100,2,"Recently, there has been a shift from using lecture-based teaching methods in undergraduate engineering courses to using more learner-centered teaching approaches, such as problem-based learning. However, research on the impact of these approaches has mainly involved student perceptions of the teaching method and anecdotal and opinion pieces by faculty on their use of the teaching method, rather than empirically collected data on students' learning outcomes. (Hypothesis) This paper describes an investigation of the impact of problem-based learning (PBL) on undergraduate electrical engineering students' conceptual understanding and their perceptions of learning using PBL as compared to lecture. Fifty-five students enrolled in an electrical engineering course at a Midwestern university participated in this research. The study utilized a within-subjects A-B-A-B research design with traditional lecture as the baseline phase and problem-based learning as the experimental phase of the study. Participants completed pre- and post-tests surrounding the four topics covered in the study and also completed a Student Assessment of Learning Gains (SALG) survey. suggested participants' learning gains from PBL were twice their gains from traditional lecture. Even though students learned more from PBL, students thought they learned more from traditional lecture. We discuss these findings and offer implications for faculty interested in implementing PBL. Given the limited research on the beneficial effects of PBL on student learning, this study provides empirical support for PBL.

Feminist theory may explain why some well-intentioned efforts actually reinforce the very conditions they seek to change. (Hypothesis) Our purpose is to understand and advance the use of feminist theory in engineering education research towards the goals of increasing gender diversity and equity in engineering. Specifically, we seek to address the following questions: How has feminist theory been engaged within engineering education scholar ship? And what opportunities exist for further engagement? We analyzed articles from Journal of Engineering Education (JEE), European Journal of Engineering (EJEE), and International Journal of Engineering Education (IJEE) that had women or gender as a central part of their studies. Titles, keywords, and abstracts for every article in the journals were reviewed for the years 1995–2008. The 88 articles directly addressing gender or women in engineering were analyzed to determine their level of engagement with feminist theory. Feminist theory is not widely engaged or systematically developed in this scholarship. Most work rests upon implicitly liberal and standpoint feminist theories, but a minority of articles point to intersectional, interactional, and masculinity studies approaches. We identified several ways in which deeper engagement with a wider range of feminist theories can benefit engineering education scholarship.

Thus, it is essential to expand our understanding of students' conceptions about the engineer phenomenon as the foundation for informing STEM education standards and curriculum. (Hypothesis) The purpose of this study was to investigate students' conceptions about engineers specifically: (1) What are elementary school students' conceptions of an engineer? (2) How might students' conceptions vary by grade level, gender, and community setting? (3) What are implications of students' conceptions for engineering education? This study was descriptive in nature and reflected a cross-age design involving the collection of qualitative data from about 400 Grade 1 through 5 students from urban and suburban schools located in the Midwest, United States. Data were analyzed using content analysis and statistical testing. Students conceptualized an engineer as a mechanic, laborer, and technician. Students' conceptions entailed the engineer fixing, building, or making and using vehicles, engines, and tools. Students' conceptions were relatively consistent across urban and suburban school communities with the exceptions that laborer was more common among urban students and technician was more common among suburban students. More than half of the students who drew a person drew male engineers. A framework for organizing and interpreting students' conceptions is presented.

Understanding how students view engineering practice can provide guidance into student responses to course features such as collaborative projects. (Hypothesis) The research question addressed in this study is: What do student portfolios reveal about student constructions of engineering? Texts from portfolios created by mechanical engineering undergraduates were analyzed qualitatively using concepts drawn from discourse analysis. This approach makes it possible to examine conceptions through close reading of linguistic structure of a body of writing. Students conceived of engineering practice as “the real world,” with most students not conceiving school experiences as integral to practice. Students conceived of engineering practice in terms of strongly contrasting elements rather than as a system of intrinsic elements. Two major aspects in student conceptions were present in the portfolios: values in engineering practice and the role of other people. Largely missing also from the student discourse was the sense that engineering is inherently collaborative. Student conceptions formed continua which bear further study to more completely characterize student views. Conceptions of engineering leaders and engineering educators deserve greater attention as well as contrasts and models for comparison to student conceptions. The benefits of understanding conceptions more completely include understanding student resistance to exercises, predicting student difficulties with exercises, and understanding the distance between what educators are trying to teach students and what students are “hearing.”",conception***discourse analysis***mechanical engineering***portfolio,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.2011.tb00016.x,1081

Although survival analysis has been used to investigate student and faculty retention, it has not been applied to undergraduate engineering student retention. (Hypothesis) The impact of cohort, gender, ethnicity, and SAT math and verbal scores on the loss rate of undergraduate engineering students was investigated to answer the questions: Does the profile of risk of dropout differ among groups with different backgrounds? When are students most likely to leave engineering? Which SAT scores better predict the risk of dropout? Using a large longitudinal database that includes 100,179 engineering students from nine universities and spans 19 years, nonparametric survival analysis was adopted to obtain nonparametric estimates of survival and associated hazard functions, and complete rank tests for the association of variables. There are significant differences for early semesters: White or female students tend to leave engineering earlier than other populations. Engineering students leave engineering during the third semester the most, although students who have an SAT math score less than 550 tend to leave engineering during the second semester. SAT math score better predicts the risk of dropout than SAT verbal score. The results of this study support using survival analysis to better understand factors that determine student success since student retention is a dynamic problem.

Mcnair***Chad Newswander***Daniel Boden***Maura Borrego,Virginia Tech***University of South Dakota***Virginia Tech***Virginia Tech,NA,100,2,"Interdisciplinary teamwork is increasingly important for engineering graduates. Yet, the reality of teaching interdisciplinarity requires faculty and students to navigate structures of engineering pro grams that do not accommodate interdisciplinary work. (Hypothesis) The purpose of this study is to understand how students and faculty negotiate interdisciplinary identities and how self-managed work teams can be used as a pedagogical strategy for promoting interdisciplinarity. Gee's concepts of affinity identity and institutional identity are used to theorize interdisciplinary teaming. Multiple data sets from observations and interviews are used to present a case study of one interdisciplinary design course from the points of view of faculty and students. This approach, combined with research literature, is used to propose a pedagogical model for interdisciplinary teaming. A pedagogical approach of self-managed teaming can promote interdisciplinary identities if (a) faculty model institutional identities as interdisciplinary researchers and instructors, (b) students are encouraged to perform as decision-makers in groups constructed through affinity identities, and (c) faculty provide scaffolding for self-managed teams and encourage valuing of different disciplinary perspectives. In the midst of an international shift toward interdisciplinarity, structural boundaries within academia present challenges to interdisciplinary collaborations. Gee's identity theory can facilitate our understanding of academic structures, especially in examining how overlapping affinity and institutional identities are at the center of newly formed interdisciplinary spaces.

Information Fluency Growth Through Engineering Curricula: Analysis of Students' Text-Processing Skills and Beliefs,2011,397,416,Roman Taraban,Texas Tech University,NA,100,2,"Based on ABET engineering criteria and goals for engineering education, students must learn to actively process information and critically evaluate written and electronic sources of information in order to achieve professional skill levels. (Hypothesis) Two hypotheses were tested: during the freshman through senior years, (i) engineering students increase their use of cognitive strategies to process written forms of information; (ii) the ways in which students respond to written information become more interpretive, analytic, and critical. Two validated scales were administered to engineering majors in their freshman through senior years. One scale measured use of reading strategies; the other measured attitudes about interpreting and critiquing written information. Additional questions concerning school-related academic and reading activities and were used to interpret the scale scores in the context of the engineering curriculum. First-year students had significantly higher analytic skills upon entry into the university, compared to a general university sample. There was a significant increase in the use of reading strategies from freshman through senior years, particularly practical reading strategies. There was also an increase in using written information as a resource, and a decline in critical analysis of written sources. Data about texts that students read linked these patterns to an emphasis in the curriculum on reading textbooks, solving textbook problems, and taking tests. These cross-sectional data suggest that engineering curricula are a significant influence in shaping the development of information fluency.

This article reviews the content and structures of instructional development programs around the world and formulates a robust framework for designing and delivering effective programs for engineering educators. Scope/Method Literature on the design, implementation, and evaluation of instructional development programs is reviewed and summarized. Five criteria drawn from Raymond Wlodkowski's theory of adult learner motivation (expertise of instructors, relevance of content, choice in application, praxis [action plus reflection], and groupwork) are proposed as a framework for designing engineering instructional development programs, and the framework is applied to formulate recommendations for making programs effective. Research questions that should be explored to validate the framework are suggested. Wlodkowski's five-factor theory of adult learner motivation provides a good framework for the design of engineering instructional development programs. The criteria are compatible with the cognitive science-based How People Learn instructional model and also with recommendations of faculty development authorities.

In addition, the learning sciences have focused very little on engineering learning to date. This article summarizes prior work in the learning sciences and discusses one perspective—situative learning— in depth. Situativity refers to the central role of context, including the physical and social aspects of the environment, on learning. Furthermore, it emphasizes the socially and culturally negotiated nature of thought and action of persons in interaction. The aim of the article is to provide a foundation for future work on engineering learning and to suggest ways in which the learning sciences and engineering education research communities might work to their mutual benefit. Scope/Method The article begins with a brief discussion of recent developments in engineering education research. After an initial overview of the field of learning sciences, situative learning is discussed and three analytical aspects of the perspective are outlined: social and material context, activities and interactions, and participation and identity. Relevant expert commentaries are interspersed throughout the article. The article concludes with an exploration of the potential for contributions from the learning sciences to understanding engineering learning.

Development of the Heat and Energy Concept Inventory: Preliminary Results on the Prevalence and Persistence of Engineering Students' Misconceptions,2012,412,438,Michael Prince***Margot Vigeant***Katharyn Nottis,Bucknell University***Bucknell University***Bucknell University,NA,101,3,"Students frequently hold a number of misconceptions related to temperature, heat and energy. There is not currently a concept inventory with sufficiently high internal reliability to assess these concept areas for research purposes. Consequently, there is little data on the prevalence of these misconceptions amongst undergraduate engineering students. (Hypothesis) This work presents the Heat and Energy Concept Inventory (HECI) to assess prevalent misconceptions related to: (1) Temperature vs. Energy, (2) Temperature vs. Perceptions of Hot and Cold, (3) Factors that affect the Rate vs. Amount of Heat Transfer and (4) Thermal Radiation. The HECI is also used to document the prevalence of misconceptions amongst undergraduate engineering students. Item analysis, guided by classical test theory, was used to refine individual questions on the HECI. The HECI was used in a one group, pre-test-post-test design to assess the prevalence and persistence of targeted misconceptions amongst a population of undergraduate engineering students at diverse institutions. Internal consistency reliability was assessed using Kuder-Richardson Formula 20; values were 0.85 for the entire instrument and ranged from 0.59 to 0.76 for the four subcategories of the HECI. Student performance on the HECI went from 49.2% to 54.5% after instruction. Gains on each of the individual subscales of the HECI, while generally statistically significant, were similarly modest. s The HECI provides sufficiently high estimates of internal consistency reliability to be used as a research tool to assess students' understanding of the targeted concepts. Use of the instrument demonstrates that student misconceptions are both prevalent and resistant to change through standard instruction.",concept inventory***heat***misconception,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.2012.tb00056.x,1103

Certain facets of the MMS intersect with qualities often perceived as desirable in engineering education. (Hypothesis) Our research questions are: To what degree do academic data support the assertion that AsAm engineering students conform to the MMS? How do AsAm engineering students express the impact of the facets of the MMS on their lived experiences? What facets of the MMS are more often reported than others among AsAm engineering students? How do AsAm engineering students perceive their fellow racial/ethnic peers fit within the MMS? The research uses a mixed methods approach including analysis of academic transcript data, surveys and semi-structured interviews. The academic record of AsAm participants was not significantly different from participants in other racial/ethnic groups. Although the AsAm participants were not found to conform to the MMS academically, they discussed their perceptions of many facets of the MMS including: being hardworking, uncomplaining and extremely intelligent, and seeking both economic attainment and educational prestige. Interestingly, many students who denied that the stereotype applied to them projected this stereotype on other AsAms. s Documentation of the existence of the MMS on our campus shows that, although AsAm students are not underrepresented, they face stereotyping and discrimination.

Thus, an assessment of the impact of students' experiences on their ethical development is warranted. (Hypothesis) We apply a conceptual framework to the study of engineering students' ethical development. This framework suggests that both formal curricular experiences and co-curricular experiences are related to students' ethical development. Using survey data collected from nearly 4,000 engineering undergraduates at 18 institutions across the U.S., we present descriptive statistics related to students' formal curricular experiences and their co-curricular experiences. Additionally, we present data for three constructs of ethical development (knowledge of ethics, ethical reasoning, and ethical behavior). For our sample, the quantity and quality of students' formal curricular experiences and their co-curricular experiences related to ethics was high. The levels of ethical knowledge and reasoning varied, as did ethical behavior. s Our data highlight opportunities for improving the engineering undergraduate/bachelor's level curricula in order to have a greater impact on students' ethical development.

Understanding student perceptions of research, and links to sex differences and personality, may shed light on the small proportion of women in undergraduate engineering programs and academia. (Hypothesis) How do personality variables and beliefs about research influence men and women's intentions to pursue a research-related career in engineering? Specifically, we test the hypotheses that: (1) Thing Orientation will be a significant predictor of intention to pursue a research career in engineering, and will be a stronger predictor of research career intentions for women than men; (2) Engineering students' beliefs and expectations about the research enterprise and researchers themselves will be associated with their desire to pursue a research career; (3) Thing Orientation will influence students' beliefs and expectancies about research. Undergraduates majoring in science, technology, engineering, or math (STEM) fields from a large research-intensive university in the USA (N = 544) reported perceptions and beliefs in a survey. Seven core beliefs about research and researchers emerge, two of which predicted interest in researchrelated careers. Thing Orientation influenced students' beliefs and expectancies about research and researchers, which in turn were related to intentions to pursue a research-related career. Thing Orientation was a better predictor of intentions to pursue a research-related engineering career for women than men. s Students' expectancies, beliefs, and Thing Orientation were predictors of planning research careers in engineering, especially for women.

This study uses mixed methods, combining surveys and focus groups. A survey emphasizing measurement of belonging, engagement, and connection to community was collected from over 750 student participants at four different institutions. Focus groups were then used to explore how students' most important communities influence their academic life. Focus group data analysis revealed which needs were met for students through participation in outside communities. Across all institutions, family is the community to which students feel most connected, with friends being a distant second. Students spoke of communities strategically, identifying needs that they meet through participation in communities and linking their participation with increased ability to engage in their academic endeavors. Most frequently, students' belonging needs were met through participation in outside communities, although safety and esteem needs were also affected. s Our results strongly suggest that, among the many types of needs studied, providing students with opportunities to belong will provide the most return on investment for engagement in academic endeavors.",belonging***community***engagement,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.2012.tb00060.x,1107

Extensive examination and broad coding of mathematics, science, technology and vocational/career standards in all 50 states identified instances of engineering content in existing standards. Explicit coding categorized engineering-relevant standards by subject area. Manual and electronic content analysis identified key engineering skills and knowledge in existing standards. Inter-rater reliability verified consistency among five individuals through descriptive statistical measures. Engineering skills and knowledge were found in 41 states' standards. Most items rated as engineering through strict coding were found in either science or technology and vocational standards. Engineering was found in only one state's math standard. Some states explicitly mentioned engineering standards without any specifics. A consensus of big ideas found in standards is provided in the discussion. s While engineering standards do exist, uniform or systematically introduced engineering standards are less prevalent.

We conducted focus groups and interviews with engineering undergraduate students, faculty, and administrators on 18 campuses. Transcripts were analyzed using both deductive and inductive analyses and constant comparison. We identified both themes of discrepancies between faculty/administrator and student perceptions and factors in the educational environment that contributed to those discrepancies. Discrepancies between the perceptions of faculty/administrators were seen in two forms. Faculty/administrators believed that ethics education encompasses teaching about laws, ethical codes, and other black-and-white solutions while also addressing more nuanced ethical dilemmas; students reported only experiencing the laws-and-rules approach. Students also did not see faculty as the positive ethical role models that faculty believed they are. Factors that contribute to both types of discrepancies are identified and reported. s This approach can be effective in examining difficulties in teaching engineering ethics.

(Hypothesis) The goal of the study was to reveal and investigate critical differences in how designers from within and outside of engineering disciplines understand what it means to design, and how those understandings are evident in their approaches to and progression through design work. A qualitative research approach called phenomenography was used to investigate critical variations in how individuals experience and understand design. Twenty practicing designers were interviewed regarding their design experiences, how they approach design, and the ways they understand design. s Six qualitatively distinct lenses on how individuals across disciplines experience and come to understand design emerged, comprising a phenomenographic “outcome space.” These include design as (1) evidencebased decision-making, (2) organized translation, (3) personal synthesis, (4) intentional progression, (5) directed creative exploration, and (6) freedom.

(2) How are individual characteristics, student experiences, and perceptions related to qualitative differences among students in their risk of attrition? Latent class analysis identifies qualitative differences among engineering students on measures of risk of attrition. A variety of covariates predict membership in each class using multinomial logistic regression. Three latent classes are identified with varying degrees of commitment to degree completion and interest in their engineering major. Individuals who are less confident, experience negative interactions with peers and instructors, and hold negative perceptions of engineering are less likely to be committed to engineering and more likely to be interested in other majors. Student experiences mediate the effects of key individual characteristics. s Certain types of student experiences are pivotal for a student's commitment to the major and commitment to degree completion.

Rather than beginning with a particular hypothesis, the study investigates predictive relationships between the variables described above and self-reported rates of test cheating among engineering undergraduates. Three hundred and eighty eight engineering undergraduates from three Midwestern U.S. institutions completed a survey based on a modified version of the theory of planned behavior as a conceptual framework. The three institutions are of different Carnegie classifications, sizes, missions, and institutional cultures. s indicate that our proposed model of ethical decision-making was successful in predicting the behavioral outcome with regard to college test cheating and there were observed significant differences in the level of cheating between institutions. However, institution as a variable was not a predictive of behavior. s The effect of institution on cheating was mitigated through other measured variables including past high school cheating, involvement in Pan-Hellenic groups, moral obligation, and perceived behavioral control.

(Hypothesis) The purposes of this study were to develop a framework to analyze instructor feedback on team responses to open-ended mathematical modeling problems and to demonstrate the use of the framework in investigating formative assessment systems. To develop the framework, formative feedback from graduate teaching assistants on first-year engineering student team responses to the Just-In Time Manufacturing Model-Eliciting Activity (MEA) was analyzed. The framework in conjunction with a four dimensional MEA Rubric was then used to identify patterns in feedback. Feedback has both form and substance. Four forms of feedback were identified: comments not intended to prompt change; and questions, open suggestions, and direct suggestions intended to prompt change. The substance was tied to the criteria used to evaluate MEA responses. s of applying the framework yielded two claims: (1) the rubric criteria influence the form and intent of feedback, and (2) the perceived quality of student work also impacts the form and intent of feedback.

Cardella,Purdue University***Purdue University***Purdue University,NA,101,1,"Design is a central and distinguishing activity of engineering and one of the core criteria for evaluating and accrediting engineering programs. Design is also a subject area that poses many challenges for faculty, and incorporating human-centered design approaches—approaches in which designers have as a focus the people they are designing for—poses additional challenges. Human-centered approaches to design contribute to innovations in engineering design and have been shown to increase productivity, improve quality, reduce errors, improve acceptance of new products, and reduce development costs. In today's globally competitive economy, it is more important than ever to develop effective design skills within the undergraduate years. (Hypothesis) Before effective design learning experiences to develop the skills needed for human-centered design can be created, an understanding of the ways in which students understand and experience human-centered design is needed. This study addresses this need by investigating the qualitatively different ways in which students experience human-centered design. A phenomenographic framework was used to guide the methodology of the study while the literature and research on human-centered design informed the construction of the study and provided ways to interpret the data and situate the findings. Thirty-three student designers from a variety of academic contexts were interviewed using a semi-structured, open-ended approach in which they discussed concrete experiences “designing for others,” and reflections and meanings associated with those experiences. Analysis of the data yielded seven qualitatively different ways in which the students experienced humancentered design; these seven categories of description formed a two-dimensional outcome space. Five of the categories were nested hierarchically. From less comprehensive to more comprehensive, those categories included: Human-centered design as “User as Information Source Input to Linear Process,” “Keep Users' Needs in Mind,” “Design in Context,” “Commitment” and “Empathic Design.” Two categories represented ways of experiencing human-centered design that were distinct: design was not humancentered, but “Technology-Centered” and human-centered design was not design, but “Service.” This study found that i) students' understanding of the user and ii) their ability to integrate that into their designs are related in the development of more comprehensive ways of experiencing human-centered design, and a conception of both aspects is needed. Furthermore, critical or immersive experiences involving real clients and users were important in allowing the students to experience human-centered design in more comprehensive ways.",human-centered design***phenomenography***user-centered design,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.2012.tb00040.x,1121

Solving design problems requires applying technical knowledge to create original ideas and turn those into practical applications. However, the impact of engineering curricula on the innovation capabilities of undergraduate engineers is not well understood. (Hypothesis) This study seeks to provide insights into the research question of whether freshman undergraduate engineering students can be more innovative than seniors. Innovation is measured in terms of the originality of the solutions they propose for an open-ended design problem, as well as the technical feasibility of those solutions for practical application. Freshman- and senior-level undergraduate engineering students were tasked with developing solutions to a specific design problem (a next-generation alarm clock). Both levels of students used a modified 6-3-5/C-sketch method for generating concepts. A fraction of both the freshman and the senior students also received innovation enhancement. ing concepts were analyzed for originality and technical feasibility. Freshman students generated concepts that were significantly more original than those of seniors, with no significant difference in quality or technical feasibility of the concepts generated by the two levels of students. s Within the limitations of the study, the findings suggest that freshman engineering students can be more innovative than their senior-level counterparts.

Research questions include: (1) Does student efficacy for CDTL change over the course of the semester? (2) What is the effect of (a) task complexity; (b) prior learner experience; (c) team composition; and (d) personal factors on efficacy for CDTL?

Which ABET Competencies Do Engineering Graduates Find Most Important in their Work?,2012,95,118,Honor J. Passow,Dartmouth College,NA,101,1,"ABET-accredited engineering programs must help students develop specific outcomes (i.e., competencies). Faculty must determine the relative emphasis among the competencies. Yet, information is sparse about the relative importance of each competency for professional practice. (Hypothesis) This study synthesizes opinions of engineering graduates about which competencies are important for professional practice. A survey asked undergraduate alumni of a large public university in the Midwest to rate the importance of the ABET competencies in their professional experience. Responses included descriptions of education, post-graduate work environment, and demographics. Protected, post-hoc, all-pairwise multiple comparisons determined patterns in the importance ratings, for the aggregate, and for descriptive subgroups. The lowest-rated competency's mean rating was 3.3 out of 5. Graduates of 11 engineering majors rated a top cluster of competencies (teamwork, communication, data analysis, and problem solving) significantly higher than a bottom cluster (contemporary issues, design of experiments, and understanding the impact of one's work). Importance ratings of five other competencies fell in an intermediate cluster in which importance was statistically tied to either the top or bottom cluster, depending on work environment or academic discipline-not demographics. The clusters were stable over time, that is, over seven survey administrations (1999–2005), years since graduation (0, 2, 6 & 10), and graduation year (1989–2003). s Graduates across engineering disciplines share a pattern of importance for professional practice among the ABET competencies that is statistically significant, consistent across demographic variables, and stable over time.

The Effectiveness of Cooperative Learning,2012,119,137,Chin-min Hsiung,National Pingtung University of Science and Technology,NA,101,1,"Empirical evidence suggests that students studying cooperatively exhibit significantly better academic achievement. However, since most prior studies do not carefully monitor the time on task, it is unclear whether the observed learning benefits are due to the intrinsic superiority of cooperative learning or merely a reflection of the increased amount of time students spend on studying. (Hypothesis) This study compares the learning effectiveness of cooperative and individualistic learning. The proposed approach carefully monitors the learning method and the time on task both in regular day-time teaching classes and out-of-class studies. A series of experiments was performed in which 42 mechanical engineering students were randomly assigned to individualistic or cooperative learning conditions, respectively, and were then formed into heterogeneous groups comprising three team members. The experiments were conducted over an 18-week semester. In conducting the experiments, the students attended both regular classes and out-of-hours homework sessions. The experimental results showed that given a sufficient period of time for the cooperative learning teams to mature, the students in the cooperative learning condition performed substantially better in both the homework and unit tests than those in the individualistic learning condition. s Since the time on task was carefully monitored, the higher academic performance of the students in the cooperative learning condition suggests that cooperative learning is more effective than individualistic learning.",cooperative learning***individualistic learning***learning effectiveness,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.2168-9830.2012.tb00044.x,1125

We also compare these students’ conceptions on the role of conceptual and procedural mathematics problems within and outside their mathematics studies. An instrument consisting of procedural and conceptual items as well as items on student opinions on the roles of the different types of knowledge in their studies was conducted with groups of second-year engineering students at two universities, one in each country. Although differences between the two countries are small, Swedish students see procedural items to be more common in their mathematics studies while the South African students find both conceptual and procedural items common; the latter group see the conceptually oriented items as more common in their studies outside the mathematics courses. s Students view mathematics as procedural.

This research review sought to demonstrate the relevance of literature on teams literature from industrial and organizational psychology to engineering education and to identify implications for practice and future directions for research. Scope/Method Phase 1 systematically reviewed 104 articles published from 2007 to 2012 describing engineering and computer science student team projects and sought to answer the following questions: What professional learning outcomes have been met by team projects? What negative student team behaviors have faculty sought to minimize? What literature has been used to inform development of teamwork outcomes? Phase 2 reviewed five team effectiveness constructs selected according to the results of Phase 1: social loafing, interdependence, conflict, trust, and shared mental models. Examples from Phase 1 articles and our own work explain how this research informs facilitation and assessment of engineering student teams. s Engineering faculty sought to achieve a variety of outcomes through team projects, including teamwork, communication, sustainability, and consideration of global/societal design context.

Previous research at the secondary level has found engineering design to be a supportive context for science learning. Designing functional artifacts may ground children's exploration of scientific concepts; engineering design may contextualize science learning. Our research investigated whether an engineering design-based curriculum changed elementary student science attitudes and science content knowledge in four domains. In the first year of the efficacy study, 12 elementary teachers taught science with their school or district's status quo curriculum. In the second year, they taught the same science content with a new engineering design-based curriculum that incorporated LEGO™ design challenges. In both years, students completed pre- and post-tests on science content and attitudinal surveys. The increase in science content performance from pre- to post-test was significantly greater for the LEGO engineering students than for the status quo students, but there was minimal difference in the science attitudes of the two student groups. s The findings suggest that engineering design-based science curriculum units may support elementary students' science content knowledge, while helping students learn to design, construct, and test solutions to engineering problems. Because students using either curriculum had similarly positive attitudes toward science, our research suggests that the benefit of engineering design for science learning cannot be attributed simply to the positive science attitudes that may result from the use of novel materials or methods.",elementary engineering design***science attitudes***science content knowledge,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jee.20026,1130

This comparative case study used ethnographic methodology to capture descriptions of the models and strategies that an expert and two advanced undergraduate student teams employed. We categorized the expert solution into steps of information gathering, problem formulation, and iterative modeling and experimentation. We identified fourteen expert competencies and used them to assess two sample student solutions. Each student solution contained some expert competencies; a higher number of expert competencies are evident in the student team that had been previously identified as higher performing. s The framework demonstrates constructive alignment of an authentic project task with evidence of student learning to evaluate the competencies students develop.

We administered two environmental surveys to students in a first-year undergraduate engineering program. First, a macrolevel analysis focused on differences between students from different U.S. regions and international students. Then, to examine differences hypothesized in our environmental awareness model at the zip code-level (students' household location, i.e., location from which they applied to college), we focused on first-year engineering students with Indiana zip codes (n = 1,367). Significant differences appeared in environmental awareness and knowledge according to students' household location (U.S. regions and international). As a result, we created a predictive model of the students' environmental knowledge, awareness, attitudes, and resistance to change using a GIS location-based model. s This study extends the existing literature and provides a starting point for further exploring these relationships with engineering students.

Analysis of the prior study of engineering students' competency formation by the author(s) is combined with a synthesis of the literature from the broad intellectual traditions of the interpretive paradigm to inform the development of a theoretical framework of research quality. Drawing on the engineering metaphor of quality management, we propose a systematic, process-oriented framework of research quality along two dimensions: a process model locates quality strategies throughout the research process, and a typology systemizes fundamental aspects of validation (theoretical, procedural, communicative, and pragmatic) and the concept of process reliability to explicate quality strategies in their fundamental contribution to substantiating knowledge claims. The quality framework provides a way to develop and demonstrate overall research quality in the interpretive inquiry by shifting attention away from assessing the research quality of a final product.

We hypothesized that adding an instructional approach in the form of inquiry learning in a virtual lab would be more effective than relying on traditional instruction alone. Students in secondary vocational engineering education were randomly assigned to one of two conditions in a quasi-experimental study. In the traditional condition, the curriculum was supplemented with computer-based practice. In the virtual lab condition, the traditional curriculum was supplemented with inquiry learning in a virtual lab. s showed that students in the virtual lab condition scored significantly higher on conceptual understanding (Cohen's d = 0.65) and on procedural skills (d = 0.76). In particular, students in this condition scored higher (d = 1.19) on solving complex problems. This result occurred for both complex conceptual and procedural problems.

Design/method Utilizing Lin's network theory of social capital as a framework, we employed semi-structured interviews in a multiple case study research methodology, taking a constructivist epistemological view. Three major findings are that (1) lack of available family social capital was supplemented mostly by school personnel; (2) delayed recognition or identification of available resources slowed access and activation of resources, leading to difficult university transitions; and (3) if accessed and activated, peer groups and institutional support systems provided sources of social capital. s Even single instances or weak ties can be effective in bridging gaps in engineering-related social capital. Facilitating opportunities for students to develop sustained social capital may have potential to attract and retain underrepresented students in engineering.",case study***Hispanic students***social capital***qualitative research***women,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jee.20010,1143

Daly,LMS North America***University of Michigan,NA,102,2,"Limited research exists on the experiences of engineering returners – those with undergraduate degrees who work for at least five years and return to academia for graduate degrees. Returners bring a different perspective to their graduate studies and postgraduate work than direct-pathway students but face additional challenges. Our aim was to understand practitioners' decisions to return to graduate school and complete graduate degrees. Guided by expectancy value theory, we investigated their beliefs about their ability to succeed; the interest, attainment, and utility values returners placed on graduate school; the costs they experienced in returning; and the personal, programmatic, and cultural factors that mitigated these costs. We employed a qualitative interpretivist approach to investigate the returning experience through semi-structured interviews with 10 returners. We analyzed the results deductively, using expectancy value theory to understand participants' expectations of success and the values of those experiences, and inductively, to understand the types of costs that influenced the decision to return and complete graduate school. Utility value drove participants' decisions to return and complete graduate programs, and participants had a high expectancy of success in earning their graduate degrees. Four types of costs emerged from analysis of the interviews: intellectual, balance, cultural and environmental, and financial. Participants employed various strategies to mitigate these costs. s With the results of our study, potential returners can more effectively plan for success in the graduate environment, and universities can develop initiatives to better recruit returners and support their success.",returning students***expectancy value theory***motivation***graduate education,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jee.20012,1144

This study directly examined how students employed a textbook in order to generate detailed descriptions of students' behaviors, approaches, and reflections regarding their actual problem-solving experiences. Method Ten senior materials engineering students (8 males and 2 females) were asked to think aloud while solving engineering problems. Follow-up retrospective interviews regarding the think aloud session were conducted to gain in-depth information on students' textbook use during the problem-solving activities. Students used the textbook primarily to find information related to problem constraints that were explicitly stated in the problem. Furthermore, textbook example problems exerted a strong influence on students' problem-solving processes. Students also reported limitations of the textbook, contrasting it to the diversity of resources available via the Internet. s This study provides insight into students' textbook use during engineering problem-solving activities.

However, the traditional engineering curriculum promotes and emphasizes engineering sciences and monodisciplinary skills and gives less priority to important collaborative skills such as sketching and visualization. This article addresses how students engage with engineering design challenges and use visual representations to develop and integrate recognitions. Our study explores how technical, analytical disciplinary competences are combined with those of qualitative, ethnographic user studies. Through a qualitative field study and an analysis of a collection of representations produced during a design process by a team of engineering students, the role of representations in the early stages of collaborative engineering design is explored. After reassembling the representations according to dates and themes, we deployed various perspectives from science and technology studies and engineering studies to assess the students' epistemic journey. Representations not only communicate findings but also incorporate analysis in their creation, and facilitate what we call collaborative design synthesis. Successful representations present and organize recognitions so that they are recognizable across other disciplines and can be integrated into new recognitions. Representations therefore shape the collaborative base of the design process and emphasize the important competences that can produce them. s The analysis shows that collaborative design synthesis is an epistemology consisting of (1) exploration, (2) inscription, (3) collection, and (4) combining and refining. The important ability of representations to draw together is termed transferability, and the competence to produce them, disciplinary mastery.",synthesis***representations***collaborative engineering design,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jee.20001,1150

Yet few studies have investigated the nature of these representations and found ways to use them in formal engineering learning. This article explores media representations of science and technology that today's adolescents are familiar with. It analyzes how the embedded representations compare with those found in academic engineering and examines how these representations influence students' knowledge of and dispositions toward engineering. In a design-based research project, a group of high school students personally selected texts (found in magazines, videos, Web sites) related to topics of mechanics and electricity. A constant comparative method was used to analyze student interviews, while discourse analysis was used to analyze their selected texts. The analyses of two exemplary texts, a Motor Trend automobile magazine article and a Mythbusters television episode, are presented to illustrate the main findings. Several characteristics of out-of-school representations are similar to engineering representations in their explanations of technically complex systems, prototype building, and testing. Out-of-school representations also present contrasting views of technology due to the diverging practices and rhetorical purposes of media professionals. This contrast poses affective challenges for beginning engineering students. s Because out-of-school representations have the potential to shape adolescents' interests, we need to understand how they create both opportunities and obstacles for engineering education and public communication.",informal learning***media***representation,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jee.20007,1151

Our novel claim is that one key mechanism of STEM integration is producing and maintaining cohesion of central concepts across the range of representations, objects, activities, and social structures in the engineering classroom. Method We analyze multiviewpoint videos of multiday classroom activities from Project Lead the Way (PLTW) classes in digital electronics in two urban high schools. To forge cohesion, teachers use coordination of representations, tools, and materials, and they use projection to reference places and events, past and future. Teachers also perform explicit identification to label central invariant relations that are the conceptual focus of their instruction. Teachers typically perform identification, coordination, and projection on the particular STEM representations used in projects in order to improve the cohesion of the conceptual content of a curriculum unit. Teachers can also represent the larger sequence of project activities within the curriculum to construct a cohesive account of how the various activities and representations relate and build upon key ideas. s This paper found that cohesion-producing activities promote student understanding by threading conceptual relations through different mathematical representations, scientific laws, technological objects, engineering designs, learning spaces, and social structures.

The design of such devices is cognitively demanding and requires the generation of multiple model representations, which are used in an iterative fashion to analyze and improve prototype designs. This study addresses two questions: How are various representations and prototypes used in the iterative design and building of a microfluidic lab-on-a-chip device in a systems biology laboratory? In this design process, what cognitive functions did the representations serve? This case study employed mixed methods. We utilized the standard ethnographic methods of participant observation, open-ended interviewing of participants, and artifact collection in an integrated systems biology research lab. Data were analyzed using open and axial coding. We also used cognitive-historical analysis to collect and analyze data from traditional historical sources (publications, grant proposals, laboratory notebooks, and technological artifacts) to recover how the salient representational, methodological, and reasoning practices were developed and used by the researchers. The device design involved complex interactions among mental models, computational models, and building and testing prototypes; tagging and visualizations were used to query and validate the prototypes as well as the computational models; all these were integrated to meet stringent experimental and fabrication constraints. Integration takes place across many different kinds of representations. The building of external representations helped not just to off-load cognitive load but also to add detail and constraints to the mental model. s Representational fluency and flexibility are required to manage the complexity of modern bioengineered devices.

The creation and use of representations is a central aspect of modeling, and students who are learning to model often use a variety of representations to express, test, revise, and communicate their own thinking. Consequently, model development often depends on representational fluency and the ability to translate between and within different representational forms. This study investigates the role that representations and representational fluency play in conceptual understanding during a complex modeling task related to heat transfer. This study involved 16 teams of 3 or 4 college students in a first-semester heat transfer course participating in a complex modeling task. The task of the student teams was to develop a model to predict the interface temperature and the sensation felt by human skin when touching a utensil made of a given material at a given temperature. Data sources included audio recordings of student teams, as well as student-generated artifacts. The results show teams thinking about their model through multiple representations and through translations within and among representations. Students' early ways of thinking used a variety of interacting representations but were often unstable and involved incomplete notions of the system to be modeled. Model development involved increasing representational fluency as well as parallel and interacting progress along a variety of dimensions. s This study furthers the understanding of representational fluency in undergraduate engineering students in a heat transfer setting and how representational fluency contributes to conceptual and application understanding.",representations***modeling***problem solving***heat transfer,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jee.20004,1154

These representational systems reveal modelers' interpretations of the relative importance of various real-world aspects. This paper illustrates how interpretations of student teams' solution models (i.e., their representational systems) to a particular problem can be used to inform educational decisions. First-year engineering teams' iterative solution models to the Travel Mode Choice Model-Eliciting Activity (MEA) were interpreted for the purpose of identifying patterns within and across teams' responses. This MEA requires the creation of a model for a client who wants to predict the mode of transportation an individual will likely take to a college campus. Teams were provided with the client's needs and sample data concerning individuals' actual travel mode and travel time, cost, and convenience for various travel modes (walk, bus, or drive). Student teams were required to submit their intermediate and final model descriptions in narrative form. Systematic study of their models resulted in identification of four different types of models. Patterns within and across model types were then used to suggest changes to the instructional system. When instructors study student models as representations of their interpretation of a real-world problem situation, insights gained can lead to practical proposals for improving instruction with authentic open-ended problems including revisions to tasks, implementation strategies, formative assessment strategies, and course content.",model-eliciting activity***open-ended problem solving***assessment,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jee.20002,1155

Through attention to their experiences, this study captures participants' points of view as they explain how they made their decisions. Students who recently left engineering were interviewed and completed a journey-mapping exercise describing their motivations and experiences. Analysis identified institutional and individual factors that contributed to their decisions to leave. Common themes of nonpersisting engineering undergraduates included individual factors (such as poor performance, feeling unprepared for demands of the engineering program, difficulty fitting into engineering) and institutional factors (such as disappointment with engineering advising). Concepts uncovered in this article not present in existing research include an emotional attachment between participants and the concept of being an engineer, students' sense of loss and failure, and their easy transition from engineering to another major. s Individual factors leading to attrition include unwillingness of students to adapt to the rigor of the engineering program and loss of confidence due to poor performance.

These factors have long been assumed to influence faculty members' choices to engage in educational improvements, but their relationships with teaching practices rarely have been studied. We examined the relationships among professional development, departmental contexts, and engineering faculty members' use of student-centered teaching practices.

We used multiple regression analyses to investigate whether graduate training, professional development, and institutional factors (e.g., reward systems) relate to engineering faculty members' use of student-centered teaching practices, such as active learning and frequent and detailed feedback to students. Professional development activities and, to a lesser extent, graduate training in teaching positively related to the use of student-centered teaching practices. We provide some of the first evidence that graduate training in teaching is linked to the use of student-centered teaching practices. Only modest relationships were observed between departmental environments and teaching practices.

Our purpose was to document current practices in engineering pedagogy with regard to opportunities for students' creative growth by examining learning goals, instructional methods, and assessments focused on cognitive creative skills. We conducted a critical case study of engineering pedagogy at a single university with seven engineering courses where instructors stated the goal of fostering creativity. Data included instructor and student interviews, student surveys, and course materials. For qualitative analysis, we used frameworks by Treffinger, Young, Selby, and Shepardson and by Wiggins and McTighe. One aspect of creativity, convergent thinking (including analysis and evaluation), was well represented in the engineering courses in our case study. However, instruction on generating ideas and openness to exploring ideas was less often evident. For many of the creative skills, especially those related to divergent thinking and idea exploration, assessments were lacking. s An analysis of pedagogy focused on goals, instruction, and assessments in the engineering curriculum revealed opportunities for growth in students' creative skill development.

Understanding Interpretive Research Through the Lens of a Cultural Verfremdungseffekt,2014,450,462,Joachim Walther,University of Georgia,NA,103,3,"Cross-cultural studies contribute to engineering education as a globally interconnected field. The methodological challenges posed by research across cultural boundaries must be explored to ensure the quality of such studies. This article explores challenges and opportunities for insight by examining the effects of researchers' and respondents' cultural norms and values on interpretive research. Method During a prior study of engineering students' competence formation in the United States, Australia, and Thailand, reflections on the project's progression were collected in the primary researcher's log trail. This article analyzes these records through the lens of a Verfremdungseffekt, whereby assumptions underlying the methodology became apparent in its transfer to a different cultural setting. Research challenges related to characteristics of Thai culture revealed three methodological insights. The pronounced power-distance in Thai culture and its effects on the prior study's focus groups highlighted the non-dualistic nature of interpretive data gathering. The culture's collectivism necessitated significant changes to the data-gathering tools, thus illustrating the need for an emergent research design in interpretive inquiries. The high-context communication characteristic of Thai society presented challenges in eliciting and collaboratively analyzing student accounts, and exposed the processes of social construction that characterize both data gathering and interpretation. These methodological insights illustrate the importance of an understanding of and engagement with the local context that span the entire research process from making to handling data.",Cross-cultural studies***interpretive methods***research quality,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jee.20053,1167
Validation of the Teaching Engineering Self-Efficacy Scale for K-12 Teachers: A Structural Equation Modeling Approach,2014,463,485,So Yoon Yoon***Miles G. Evans***Johannes Strobel,Texas A&M University***Purdue University***Texas A&M University,NA,103,3,"Teacher self-efficacy has received attention because of its direct relationship with teachers' classroom behaviors. Since engineering has been increasingly introduced in K-12 (precollege) education, development of an instrument to measure teachers' self-efficacy in the context of teaching engineering has been needed. (Hypothesis) This study reports the development and validation of the Teaching Engineering Self-Efficacy Scale (TESS) for K-12 teachers. The items for the TESS were constructed through a comprehensive review of the literature regarding K-12 engineering education, the development of teachers' self-efficacy instruments in STEM areas, and K-12 teachers' reflections on integrating engineering into their classrooms. During the content and face validity process, we used structural equation modeling to identify and confirm the factor structure of the TESS, and used item-analyses for reliability evidence. With data from 434 teachers in 19 states, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses using structural equation modeling resulted in the TESS consisting of 23 items loading across four factors: engineering pedagogical content knowledge, engineering engagement, engineering disciplinary self-efficacy, and outcome expectancy. Cronbach's α ranged from 0.89 to 0.96 and exhibited high internal consistency reliability coefficients for the TESS. s Teacher self-efficacy is a situation-specific construct because teachers' efficacy beliefs depend on the content area and teaching environment. Use of the TESS, as an instrument tailored for the engineering teaching context, can contribute to the literature on K-12 engineering education and improve the teaching of precollege engineering.",K-12 engineering education***teacher self-efficacy***TESS,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jee.20049,1168
Anatomy of Scholarly Collaboration in Engineering Education: A Big-Data Bibliometric Analysis,2014,486,514,Hanjun Xian***Krishna Madhavan,Microsoft Corp***Purdue University,NA,103,3,"Engineering education has become a large community with an increasing number of scholars and publications. As the number of publications has grown, it has become increasingly difficult to understand the epistemic nature and diffusion characteristics of knowledge generated by this community. Techniques to study community topology require nontrivial computational workflows. /Hypothesis The present study characterizes the topology of scholarly collaboration and important factors affecting this topology in engineering education research. Design/ A bibliometric analysis was conducted of 24,172 papers in engineering education research journals and conference proceedings for the years 2000–2011. A total of 29,116 unique authors are present. Social network analyses were used to characterize the network topology of overall scientific collaboration. Analyses based on grouping scholars by disciplinary backgrounds, research areas, and geographical locations were performed. The results show that the engineering education research community is in its early stage of forming a small-world network that relies primarily on 5% of scholars to build capacity. Typical small-world networks provide some very clear characterizations about the state, stability, and growth of the community. Deviations from this ideal model suggest the need for rethinking collaboration in engineering education. Scholars with interdisciplinary backgrounds play a critical role in bridging isolated research teams. s Compared with other disciplines and the ideal small-world network model, the topology of collaboration in engineering education shows significant barriers to the fast diffusion of innovations.

Increasing the Use of Evidence-Based Teaching in STEM Higher Education: A Comparison of Eight Change Strategies,2014,220,252,Maura Borrego***Charles Henderson,Virginia Tech***Western Michigan University,NA,103,2,"Prior efforts have built a knowledge base of effective undergraduate STEM pedagogies, yet rates of implementation remain low. Theories from higher education, management, communication, and other fields can inform change efforts but remain largely inaccessible to STEM education leaders, who are just beginning to view change as a scholarly endeavor informed by the research literature. This article describes the goals, assumptions, and underlying logic of selected change strategies with potential relevance to STEM higher education settings for a target audience of change agents, leaders, and researchers. Scope/Method This review is organized according to the Four Categories of Change Strategies model developed by Henderson, Beach, and Finkelstein (2011). We describe eight strategies of potential practical relevance to STEM education change efforts (two from each category). For each change strategy, we present a summary with key references, discuss their applicability to STEM higher education, provide a STEM education example, and discuss implications for change efforts and research. s Change agents are guided, often implicitly, by a single change strategy. These eight strategies will expand the repertoire of change agents by helping them consider change from a greater diversity of perspectives. Change agents can use these descriptions to design more robust change efforts. Improvements in the knowledge and theory base underlying change strategies will occur when change agents situate their writing about change initiatives using shared models, such as the one presented in this article, to make their underlying assumptions about change more explicit.",curriculum change***instructional change***theories of change,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jee.20040,1173

In these contending response strategies there are deep-seated, underlying historical tensions at work. This article aims to create a theoretical and conceptual framework, which allows engineering educators to reflect on their perceptions and practices in regard to institutional change and reform. Design A historical review traces the history of the tensions between different traditions of engineering education from their medieval roots through the institutionalization of engineering education in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and discusses the different conceptions of engineering and engineering knowledge on which they are based. We then relate the historical review to educational conceptualizations of the university as well as curriculum models. On the basis of a synthesis of the historical and educational perspectives, we present an analytical distinction between three modes of engineering education. We propose a transformation to an integrative mode that is less prominent historically, but growing in importance. By introducing the term hybrid learning, we furthermore outline important aspects to be considered in the process of transforming engineering education. s We conclude by inviting engineering educators, students, administrators, and policy makers to consult our theoretical and conceptual framework and consider a transformation to an integrative mode.

Transforming these policies may significantly affect who becomes an engineer. This article reports the outcome of using research results to inform change in admission policy at a Midwestern public university. There were three research questions: Is there statistically significant evidence of admission decision gender bias for engineering applicants? Do affective and cognitive factors predictive of engineering student success differ between men and women? Can a difference in the resulting admitted class be confirmed when such factors inform admission policy? Admissions records were examined for differences in cognitive metrics between men and women. Student records were analyzed before and after the policy change. Neural network modeling of student records predicted the cognitive and affective measures most important for success in retention and graduation. Statistical analysis indicated a gender bias in the admission process results, which was traced back to the policy. Success factor modeling suggested a different set of criteria could mitigate this bias. After admission criteria were changed, statistical analysis confirmed the gender bias against women was mitigated. s The application of research and the change process described shows the important role of research in motivating and informing policy change.

In considering how to engage researchers and practitioners in “cycles of educational practice and research” (Jamieson & Lohmann, 2009), we focus on individuals and what motivates them to create and sustain innovations within the engineering education system. Through this study, we seek to better understand why faculty do or do not engage in the research–practice cycle. Specifically, we employ expectancy value theory and examine the success and value beliefs motivating individuals' choices. We used mixed methods assessment data from two engineering education conferences that focused on promoting transformational change. Data included observational notes, open-ended written responses submitted after conference sessions, open-ended survey questions, and quantitative survey questions. For data analysis. we used descriptive statistics and open coding techniques. We identified expectancy of success and cost value and utility value as important to participants. Notably, the same motivation constructs generally matter for research, practice, and research-informed practice, although practice-informed research was nearly absent from the data. Participants cited strategies that are currently working to improve only some of the success and value categories. s Expectancy value theory provides a useful framework for understanding faculty choices in the research–practice cycles required for change and innovation in engineering education.

Yet the adoption of such practices has been slow at many institutions. Efforts to bridge the gap between research and practice are needed. We describe an institutional change plan we developed to bridge this research-to- practice gap. Our plan is grounded in research and theories about faculty motivation and organizational change, and we designed it using local evidence from the University of Michigan College of Engineering. We collected local data from three sources to provide context for our institutional change plan. First, faculty focus groups allowed us to determine factors that influence faculty adoption of effective teaching practices. Second, classroom observations allowed us to ascertain current teaching practices. Third, a student survey allowed us to identify teaching practices perceived by students to enhance their success. We used this local evidence with a “who/what/how” decision-making process to design our change plan. Our institutional change plan for accelerating the adoption of effective teaching practices comprises a faculty action plan and an administrative change plan. Although still evolving, there is evidence of the success of both parts. s Local evidence is critical in our change plan.

Research suggests that students' ways of knowing and beliefs about what counts as knowing and learning – their personal epistemologies – can be aspects of their identities, or sense of self as knowers and learners. /Hypothesis Combining personal epistemology and identity theories suggests epistemological aspects of students' identities can influence whether they feel they belong in their engineering program. We have two research questions: Can a high-achieving engineering student be in danger of leaving a program because of a mismatch between epistemological aspects of his identity and his perceptions of the intellectual climate of their program? How does such a mismatch affect the student's day-to-day academic experiences? For three years, we followed Michael, an electrical engineering student, through interviews and in-class observations. From more than 12 hours of semistructured clinical interviews, more than 10 hours of videotaped discussion sections, and two in-class observations in lectures, we produced a case study to characterize epistemological aspects of Michael's identity and how they influenced his perception of his program. Michael expressed and enacted a sense-making epistemology that is a fundamental aspect of his identity as a learner. Due to this sense-making aspect of Michael's identity, he often felt alienated from the intellectual climate of his program, and he considered leaving engineering.

A two-phase analysis of student conceptions was undertaken. Phase I analyzed the conceptions of an experimental group before and after they were taught an explicit modeling module. Phase II added a comparison group at a second institution. A significant shift was observed for engineering students who were explicitly taught a modeling module. Student-held conceptions were predominantly descriptive-centric (e.g., physical models) throughout the investigation with an added focus on predictive (e.g., mathematical) modeling after completing the modeling module.

Although the taxonomy focuses on engineering education research in the United States, inclusive efforts have engaged 266 individuals from 149 cities in 30 countries during one multiday workshop, seven conference sessions, and several other virtual and in-person activities. The resulting taxonomy comprises 455 terms arranged in 14 branches and six levels. This taxonomy was found to satisfy four criteria for validity and reliability: (1) keywords assigned to a set of abstracts were reproducible by multiple researchers, (2) the taxonomy comprised terms that could be selected as keywords to fully describe 243 articles in three journals, (3) the keywords for those 243 articles were evenly distributed across the branches of the taxonomy, and (4) the authors of 31 conference papers agreed with 90% of researcher-assigned keywords.

Freshmen and seniors spent significantly less time determining the feasibility of their ideas, evaluating alternative ideas, and decision making than experts. s High school students engage in design thinking with little understanding of the problem from the client's perspective. Students tend to become fixated on a single solution rather than comparing alternatives. By encouraging development of alternative solutions, K-12 engineering education could foster opportunities to critically evaluate students' design solutions.",engineering design***high school***engineering education,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jee.20105,1191

Bekki,Arizona State University***Arizona State University***Arizona State University,NA,104,4,"Effective interpersonal communication skills in the advisor-advisee relationship context are important to the success of graduate students. Few instruments have previously been developed to assess students' communication skills in this context. /Hypothesis This study reports the development and validation of the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math Interpersonal Communication Skills Assessment Battery (STEM ICSAB) for women doctoral students in engineering, mathematics, computer sciences, and the physical sciences. The STEM ICSAB consists of three instruments: the Interpersonal Communication Knowledge Assessment, Interpersonal Communication Coping Self-Efficacy Assessment, and the Interpersonal Communication Skills Assessment. The STEM ICSAB was developed in three stages. Stage I consisted of item generation and establishment of content validity. In Stage II, an exploratory analysis with a convenience sample of undergraduate and graduate students determined the initial factor structure of each instrument. In Stage III, a confirmatory factor analysis with a sample of women doctoral students further examined the factor structures derived from Stage II. The Knowledge assessment has 20 items, the Coping Self-Efficacy assessment has 12 items, and the Skills assessment has five items. All three measures fit a unidimensional factor structure and demonstrate moderate to high internal consistency. This study provides initial support for the psychometric properties of the STEM ICSAB.

We propose an analytic framework for evaluating the validity arguments of CIs. We focus on three types of claims: that CI scores enable one to infer (1) students' overall understanding of all concepts identified in the CI, (2) students' understanding of specific concepts, and (3) students' propensity for misconceptions or common errors. Method We applied our analytic framework to three CIs: the Concept Assessment Tool for Statics (CATS), the Statistics Concept Inventory (SCI), and the Dynamics Concept Inventory (DCI). Using our analytic framework, we found varying degrees of support for each type of claim. CATS and DCI analyses indicated that the CIs could reliably measure students' overall understanding of all concepts identified in the CI, whereas SCI analyses provided limited evidence for this claim. Analyses revealed that the CATS could accurately measure students' understanding of specific concepts; analyses for the other two CIs did not support this claim. None of the CI analyses provided evidence that the instruments could reliably measure students' misconceptions and common errors. s Our analytic framework provides a structure for evaluating CI validity.

Contextual Constraining of Student Design Practices,2015,252,278,Andrea Goncher***Aditya Johri,Queensland University of Technology***George Mason University,NA,104,3,"Engineering design is of significant interest to engineering educators. As yet, how the higher education context shapes student outcomes in engineering design courses remains underexplored. Since design courses are the primary way students are taught the critical topic of design, it is important to understand how the institutional and organizational contexts shape student outcomes and how we could improve design projects, given the context. We sought to answer two questions: What aspects of the design education process are salient, or important, for students? How do these salient aspects affect their design practices? We used a qualitative case study approach to address the research questions because of our emphasis on understanding process-related aspects of design work and developing an interpretive understanding from the students’ perspective. Using a nested structuration framework, we show that the context of design practices shaped students’ outcomes by constraining their approach to the project and by providing a framework for their design process. We provide recommendations for design educators to help students overcome impediments to achieving learning objectives for design activities. Our research questions the efficacy of teaching engineering design when a design problem lacks a context beyond the classroom. s The institutional and organizational contexts influence student design practices.

The beliefs of faculty members about instructional practice are an important construct in determining what and how they teach. This study investigates the effect of faculty members’ involvement in model-eliciting activities on their beliefs about classroom instruction. This study is guided by the following research question: How do faculty members’ beliefs about teaching, learning, and assessment change through the use of model-eliciting activities (MEAs)? Using a multicase study design, four engineering faculty members from across the United States were studied while they developed, implemented, and assessed MEAs. Data were collected from sources including semistructured interviews about teaching beliefs and practices, a demographics and academic background survey, and biweekly surveys on MEA implementation and beliefs. Yearly interviews were coded using a rubric that classifies beliefs on a scale from instructor-centered to student-centered. Over the course of the three-year study, the beliefs of all four faculty members shifted towards a more student-centered view of teaching. The faculty members indicated that they were able to emphasize teamwork, real-world practice, problem-solving skills, timely feedback, constructed knowledge, communication, active learning, formative assessment, and the discipline of engineering through the use of MEAs. s This study provides evidence that developing and implementing MEAs can help both experienced and beginning faculty members change their beliefs toward a student-centered view of instruction.",instructor beliefs***modeling***undergraduate engineering education,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jee.20081,1197

Using principles of cognitive psychology and concept mapping assessment, we hypothesized that correlations between cognitive style and the selected concept map metrics are not statistically significant. Concept maps from 104 engineering undergraduates in a first-year design course were analyzed using 12 traditional scoring metrics and four holistic scoring metrics. One holistic metric was expanded to allow more detailed evaluation, bringing the number of map metrics to 20. Cognitive style was measured using the Kirton Adaption–Innovation Inventory, a psychometric instrument previously applied in engineering education contexts. Relationships between the concept map metrics and cognitive style were investigated using standard linear techniques. s show substantial support for the null hypothesis that cognitive style and concept mapping performance are uncorrelated. s Engineering educators can be confident that the concept map metrics used here reflect cognitive level and not cognitive style.

Although prior studies have explored Chinese students’ adjustment issues in U.S. institutions, such as language capabilities, socialization, and learning experiences, little is known about the cognitive aspects of their academic experiences. This study adopted Perry's theory, which describes college students’ epistemological development from a dualistic to a relativistic manner of thinking in four stages, to map the epistemological developmental profiles of Chinese engineering doctoral students in U.S. institutions. Method The dominant epistemological development stages of Chinese engineering doctoral students from five Midwestern universities were identified through a quantitative survey with four subscales corresponding to Perry's four stages. ANOVA tests explored differences in the subscales concerning demographic parameters. The results suggested that the dominant thinking styles of nearly 80% of the students fell into the latter two stages of Perry's theory. Significant differences were observed in survey subscales regarding factors such as students’ academic progress and university at the time of research. s The study offers a profile of Chinese engineering doctoral students’ epistemological development using Perry's theory.

Engineering Students' Epistemological Views on Mathematical Methods in Engineering,2015,139,166,Julie Gainsburg,California State UniversityNorthridge,NA,104,2,"This study was motivated by the ubiquity and apparent usefulness of general epistemological development schemes, notably that of William J. Perry, Jr., in engineering education, but also by limitations that derive from their generality. /Hypothesis Empirical data were used to articulate engineering students' epistemological views on the role of mathematical methods in engineering and to explore the fit of a stage-based developmental model to those data. Data included interviews, think-aloud protocols, and classroom observations over a one-year period. Ten undergraduates and four instructors in a civil engineering program participated. A grounded-theory approach was used to identify levels of epistemological views. Perry's scheme provided a starting framework. Skeptical reverence, the view veteran engineers hold regarding mathematics in engineering, which was previously identified by the author, was taken as a normative endpoint. All data were coded by view level and various contexts to detect students' epistemological developmental patterns. This article proposes three categories of engineering students' views on the role of mathematical methods in engineering: dualism, integrating, and relativism. Dualism and relativism reflect elements of Perry's general categories, but integrating, a new category, diverges significantly from Perry's middle category of multiplicity. No evidence supported a stage-based developmental model. s This empirically based scheme, while exploratory, provides further evidence that epistemological development differs across disciplines, and offers four levels of epistemological views held by engineering students on the role of mathematics in engineering.

Personality traits were assessed by the NEO Five-Factor Inventory and a measure of locus of control. A multinomial logistic regression was performed with students who persisted as the reference group. Significant aptitude predictors for retention were high school GPA, SAT math, and ALEKS scores. Conscientiousness was the only significant personality factor. Math skills, especially calculus readiness, were strong predictors of retention.

Academic integration and intention to persist were important for completion of credits for both genders. Social integration was only important for men's academic success. Females seemed to benefit less from good preparation through active learning during secondary education, and the effect of a high grade point average on math was negative for females but positive for males. s Interactionalist concepts can explain academic success, but the relationships among concepts vary by gender.

Systematic review methods, widely used in fields such as medicine, psychology, and education, are being applied in engineering education. Analysis of current systematic review practices in engineering education can contribute to continuous improvement of an important set of synthesis methodologies. To promote continuous improvement in systematic reviews, researchers are currently developing criteria to evaluate the quality of systematic review methodologies. The purpose of this article is to identify prior systematic reviews in areas of interest to the engineering education community, use these criteria to critique these systematic reviews, and make recommendations for improving use and quality of systematic review methods in engineering education research. Scope/Method Using systematic review search methodologies, we identified 12 conference papers and 37 journal articles that are systematic reviews published since 1990. Two reviewers coded each by topic, education level, quantitative or qualitative sources and synthesis methods, and 18 quantitative measures of review quality. Interrater reliability was calculated using kappa as described by Landis and Koch, which ranged from 0.43 (moderate) to 0.80 (almost perfect) with overall agreement of 0.64 (substantial). s We found that the 49 identified systematic reviews in engineering education are particularly strong in stating their purposes, rationale, and inclusion criteria.

Those questions combined to measure a single concept (structural validity), the scale reliably measures (Cronbach's alpha = .91) that concept, and it focuses on contextual competence instead of other student outcomes (discriminant validity). The contextual competence scale varies according to students' characteristics and curricular experiences as well as similarities and differences in student and alumni levels of contextual competence in the same programs and institutions (criterion-related validity). Finally, the scale may be a more accurate measure of contextual competence than faculty members' perceptions of students' ability. s The contextual competence scale allows engineering programs to meet ABET and other self-study requirements or do large-scale research with relative ease and little expense.

We then used grounded theory to identify and analyze statements from the interviews and to develop a conceptual model of student beliefs. The resulting model has five major categories: the problem-solving process itself, the role of classroom problems, the role of workplace problems, personal characteristics that affect problem solving, and resources that assist problem solving. Students identify a sharp distinction between classroom problems and workplace problems. s Our conceptual model provides an initial framework for understanding how students' beliefs affect their approaches to engineering problems. In contrast to stage models, our model shows that students' epistemic beliefs about problem solving are contextual. Future work is needed to understand the limits and extend the applicability of our model.",problem solving***qualitative***grounded theory***beliefs,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jee.20150,1219
Selecting Effective Examples to Train Students for Peer Review of Open-Ended Problem Solutions,2016,585,604,Matthew A. Verleger***Kelsey J. Rodgers***Heidi A. Diefes-Dux,Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University***Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University***Purdue University,NA,105,4,"Students conducting peer review on open-ended problem solutions require training. For that training, the selection of training examples is critical. This study explored how the characteristics of five example solutions used in training and their associated expert evaluations affected students' abilities to score peer team solutions on a model-eliciting activity (MEA). For this training, individual students reviewed a randomly selected example solution to an MEA. They were then asked to compare their review and an expert's review. Students were then assigned a peer team solution to review. An expert later rated the five training examples and 147 team solutions that had been peer reviewed. Differences between the scores assigned by the expert and a student to a training example and a peer team solution were used to compute the student's improvement as reviewer from training to peer review. ANOVA testing with Tukey's post hoc analysis identified differences in improvement based on the training example students saw during training. Statistically significant differences were found in the number of errors students made during peer review depending on the quality of the example they reviewed in training. Specifically, a low-quality example and associated expert evaluation resulted in more accurate scoring during peer review. s While students typically ask to see exemplar solutions, this research suggests that there is likely greater value, for the purpose of training for peer reviewing, in having students see expert evaluations of lower-quality examples.",Peer review***peer instruction***model-eliciting activities,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jee.20148,1220

The purpose of this study was to identify important mentoring KSAs for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers who serve as mentors in engineering and science UR settings and to use these KSAs to develop a survey that mentors can use to assess their beliefs about their mentoring KSAs. In Phase I of the study, semistructured interviews were conducted with one postdoctoral researcher and 16 graduate students who were recognized by their students as outstanding mentors. In Phase II, survey items were created from the results of Phase I for assessing the beliefs of graduate students and postdoctoral researchers about their mentoring KSAs. The study identified important mentoring KSAs and produced a 30-item survey that assesses the beliefs of mentors about their mentoring KSAs; the items are grouped into four factors: building a positive working relationship, recognizing individual student needs and personalizing the mentoring approach, monitoring students' daily tasks, and building a personal relationship with students. s The study findings can help graduate students and postdoctoral researchers to become better mentors in UR settings by identifying important mentoring KSAs and by enabling them to assess their beliefs about their mentoring KSAs.",mentoring***undergraduate research***mixed research methods***graduate students,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jee.20129,1221

This study sought to understand the effect of engineering-centered literature and academic conversations to enhance linguistically diverse kindergarten students' engagement with engineering content. A withdrawal single-case study with multiple measures was conducted to document the effects of the literacy-enriched engineering intervention program. The frequencies of three types of engagement were recorded: behavioral, affective, and cognitive engagement. Participation in discussions was also recorded to monitor academic conversations. Six female kindergarten students whose first language was not English, representing three ability levels, were targeted for data collection. The relative value of the types of engagement and discussion participation increased. These increases generally declined when the intervention was withdrawn. All ability levels showed significant increase during intervention. Engagement peaked during hands-on engineering design activities for all students. A second peak occurred during the engineering picture book read-aloud with active engagement activities. The combination of activities in the intervention is effective for English language learners and can improve engagement for all ability levels. Academic conversations enhanced all lessons by increasing discussion participation. s show a functional relationship between enjoying the learning activities and being motivated to participate in discussion.

However, ESSCs are relatively recent, and there are gaps in our knowledge about how they are intentionally designed to function alongside engineering curricula. /Hypothesis The purpose of this article is to develop a conceptual model that graphically represents the practices of and intentions behind ESSCs. A multi-case study design was used to examine the efforts of six ESSCs housed at four institutions. Using qualitative methods, we collected data from student-support practitioners (those who provide support) and students (those who receive support). The data were analyzed through the development of a logic model. The primary result of this study is an empirically based conceptual model, the model of co-curricular support (MCCS), for constructing and evaluating support systems and individual student interventions. The MCCS builds on Tinto's model of institutional departure and demonstrates the breadth of assistance required to comprehensively support undergraduate students at the college level. s The MCCS indicates how a student's interactions with the academic, social, and professional systems in a college and the larger university system can influence a student's success in an undergraduate degree program.

Differences in Classroom Engagement of Asian American Engineering Students,2016,431,451,Marsha Ing***Christine Victorino,University of CaliforniaRiverside***University of CaliforniaRiverside,NA,105,3,"Asian American experiences have been largely ignored in the engineering education research literature. Asian Americans are often considered as a homogenous group, despite including over 40 different ethnic subgroups who speak over 300 languages. The immigrant trajectories, cultural experiences, and college completion rates of Asian Americans also vary. This study compares classroom engagement of Asian American subgroups whose members are undergraduate engineering majors, and next examines the relationship between classroom engagement and grade point averages across subgroups. Survey responses from Asian Americans in undergraduate engineering programs at nine campuses in a public research university system were analyzed using quantitative methods to test for measurement invariance in terms of classroom engagement. The classroom engagement was correlated with grade point average, after controlling for prior achievement and student demographics. There was evidence of measurement invariance of classroom engagement across Asian American subgroups. Classroom engagement was higher for the East Indian/Pakistani subgroup than the Chinese, Filipino, and Thai subgroups. There was also evidence that classroom engagement was significantly related to grade point average. However, the low effect sizes suggest that these items may not adequately capture classroom engagement. s Disaggregating data by subgroups provides important information regarding student classroom engagement and academic outcomes.

The EPRA measures students' social responsibility attitudes and operationalizes the professional social responsibility development model, which describes the development of personal and professional social responsibility in engineers. The EPRA is intended to be used by educators to assess curricular interventions aimed at changing students' views of social responsibility. The EPRA was developed in an iterative manner, using five different survey administrations with adjustments made to the instrument between each. Data from the final survey with 1,000 student responses were used to develop evidence of validity through expert feedback, structural equation modeling, multidimensional item response theory, and convergent evidence of validity and evidence of reliability using ordinal alpha. Evidence of validity and reliability indicates the appropriateness of the EPRA to measure social responsibility attitudes in engineering students. s The evidence of reliability and validity shows that the EPRA may be a useful tool to assess engineering student views of social responsibility, changes in those views over time, and the effectiveness of educational interventions intended to affect these attitudes.",Social responsibility***validity***reliability***assessment tools***structural equation modeling,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jee.20124,1229

We asked, What are the dominant themes and patterns in the structure of gender research published in JEE? We wanted to see how engineering education research articles incorporated gender theory and research methods from the social sciences and education to explore the relationships between gender and engineering education. We conducted a content analysis of gender-related research published in JEE between 1998 and 2012. We developed scientometric and other classification categories and applied them quantitatively. Articles related to gender are predominantly quantitative studies that focus on undergraduate students in formal university settings, and incorporate participant identities in the groups of women and men (together) or women, men, and racial minorities (together). Researchers used varied theories of gender, but most of those theories were not used again in later research in the articles analyzed. s A greater diversity of theories and designs should lead to a better understanding of gender in engineering education.

The data were from the Sustainability and Gender in Engineering survey distributed during fall 2011 (N = 6,772). Structural equation modeling was used to understand first-year students' affective beliefs for predicting engineering career choice. Math and physics identities are important for predicting engineering choice at the beginning of college. Recognition from others and interest in a subject are positive predictors of physics and math identities. Students' performance/competence beliefs alone are negative predictors of engineering career choice but are mediated by interest and recognition from others. Student identities and agency beliefs are significant predictors of engineering career choice, explaining 20% of the variance.

Multiple regression analyses examined the relationship between engineering self-efficacy and academic achievement and intent to persist in engineering, both uniquely and when considering other motivation variables. Factor analysis results suggested two self-efficacy scales. The General Engineering Self-Efficacy Scale is unidimensional; the Engineering Skills Self-Efficacy Scale is multidimensional with three factors representing experimental skills, tinkering skills, and design. General engineering self-efficacy predicted academic achievement, even when prior achievement was controlled. Students' intrinsic value in engineering predicted their intentions to persist in the engineering profession. s We found evidence for the reliability, validity, and predictive utility of the engineering self-efficacy scales.

Guyotte***Joachim Walther,University of Georgia***University of Alabama***University of Georgia,NA,105,1,"There is a growing interest in STEAM (STEM + the Arts) education as a means to enhance the creativity of STEM students and broaden interest in STEM fields. Many art educators, however, object to the instrumental justification for study in the arts as a way to improve student performance in other areas. Drawing on the first two authors' engagement in an interdisciplinary design studio, this study develops an expanded view of how STEAM might enrich engineering education in ways that more closely align with the pedagogical commitments of the arts. This article is written as a collaborative autoethnography between the first two authors, educators in environmental engineering and art education, respectively. The study is grounded in the educational philosophy of arts advocate Maxine Greene, who views learning as an active, collaborative search for meaning, “wide-awakeness,” and social change. Our dialogue reveals the potential for STEAM to provide students and educators with opportunities to explore personally relevant connections between materials, design, society, and the natural environment and to critically engage with implicit and explicit facets of disciplinary identity. s This view of STEAM simultaneously complements and challenges current conceptions of this emerging educational movement that, almost without exception, are underpinned by calls for competitive economic growth and technological development.

We used a sequential mixed methods approach that began with interviews and focus groups with 165 participants and continued with a questionnaire administered to over 2,500 engineering students and practicing engineers both involved and not involved with engineering service. Analyses included variable-oriented qualitative analysis and multiple linear regression models to compare perceived technical and professional skills. Quantitative results show that engineers involved and not involved with engineering service report comparable perceived technical skills, and that those involved in engineering service report significantly higher perceived professional skills, even when controlling for age, gender, and grade point average. Qualitative results indicate that higher professional skills can be partially attributed to the realistic, complex, and contextualized learning experiences within engineering service activities. s Engineers involved with engineering service may gain strong professional engineering skills that do not compromise their technical skills.

We applied secondary qualitative analysis to interviews with 31 engineering undergraduates: 11 African American students and 20 Latino students from 11 universities. Each type of community cultural wealth took various forms and contributed to student persistence. Students alluded to navigational and aspirational capital most often. African American men and women activated particular types of capital differently. Women with different racial/ethnic backgrounds also relied on different forms of capital or methods of activation. s The types of capital are dynamic in how they interact with one another.

Categorical scoring requires judges to categorize concepts according to relevant categories before quantification of overall complexity. In this study, concept maps were collected from 72 undergraduates before and after a capstone design course. Judges analyzed the concept maps using three methods. Using statistical analyses, we examined the comparability, interrater reliability, and convergent/divergent validity of scoring methods. While traditional scoring allowed judges to score concept maps relatively quickly, holistic scoring allowed judges to better capture changes in knowledge structure, because ranking of data was required without assuming hierarchical concept arrangement. Only categorical scoring provided insight into content and structure of student knowledge. For all methods, interrater reliability was acceptable, and convergent/divergent validity was established. s Due to its applicability to concept maps of varying structures, holistic scoring is best if more than one judge is available; traditional scoring is appropriate if there are time constraints or if multiple methods are used. Categorical scoring has potential as a supplemental or stand-alone method, depending on the needs of the instructor or researcher.",concept maps***conceptual learning***assessment tools***reliability***validity,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jee.20111,1250

Yet practices for promoting its development in engineering students both within and outside of ethics education remain largely underexplored. The objective of this investigation was twofold: first, we explored the aspects of an engineering ethics course that contributed to changes in perspective-taking among graduate-level engineering students. Second, we explored the nature of these changes. We used Critical Incident Technique to explore these two research objectives. To enhance the rigor of this qualitative investigation, we implemented Walther, Sochacka, and Kellam's Quality Framework. The analysis of 24 critical incidents extracted from post-course interviews resulted in five distinct but related themes representing potential causes of changes in perspective-taking. Themes included the sharing of diverse perspectives, the challenge of ethical decision-making, projection exercises, repetitive application of Reflexive Principlism, and experiencing cognitive dissonance. Second, we found four themes representing the nature of perspectivetaking changes, including open-mindedness, holistic perspective-taking, principle-based perspective-taking, and worldview broadening. s These findings elucidate nuances engineering educators might consider when seeking perspective-taking development among their students, such as the nature of case study prompts and the relationship between perspective-taking and ethical reasoning processes.",ethics***student development***qualitative***Critical Incident Technique***empathy,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jee.20175,1255

(b) How do the instructor's discursive interactions in design groups influence student design? Method In this exploratory case study, discursive patterns and interaction patterns between four student groups and their instructor were captured through audio and video recordings. The design discourse structure and patterns differed among groups, affecting their design decisions. There was also a difference in both the number of new ideas generated and, most notably, the level of student engagement in those groups. In addition, the complexity of design decisions varied, with most groups focusing on financial feasibility rather than scientific reasoning. Finally, it was observed that the instructor discourse influenced student engagement in design discourse and the use of scientific reasoning and justifications in small group discussions. s This discourse study offers insight into students’ scientific reasoning in an effort to help educators more effectively structure instruction discourse and practices in engineering design in K-12 science education.","case study***design practice***discourse analysis***engineering curriculum, K-12",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jee.20176,1257

Competency-based learning (CBL) is an outcome-based, student-centered form of instruction where students progress to more advanced work upon mastering the necessary prerequisite content and skills. Many articles have been published on the implementation of CBL in engineering higher education; however, the literature lacks a systematic review that summarizes prior work to inform both future research and practice. The purpose of this review is to integrate previous literature as well as identify gaps in competency-based engineering higher education research. It summarizes the different approaches for implementing CBL, the effects of the pedagogy on student outcomes, tools to enhance its effectiveness, and assessment strategies. In addition, suggestions and recommendations for future research are provided. Method Engineering education articles were obtained from several EBSCO educational databases. The search was limited to articles published from 2005-2015, and inclusion criteria consisted of peer-reviewed journal articles that address the use of CBL in engineering higher education. Articles were then classified into several categories, summarized, and evaluated. s Theoretical and applied perspectives are provided that address both the theoretical basis for the effectiveness of CBL and practical aspects of implementing successful CBL instruction in engineering education.

Factor analysis revealed three categories of values (interest, attainment, and career utility) that were largely consistent with those in Eccles’ expectancy-value framework. A similar analysis identified three categories of costs (balance, financial, and academic) associated with pursuing a PhD. Returners felt significantly less confident in their ability to complete their degrees prior to enrolling and perceived higher levels of all cost types than direct-pathway students. s Given the differences between returning and direct-pathway students, it is important to consider how universities might best recruit and retain returners.

Benson,The University of Tennessee***Clemson University,NA,106,4,"Students' beliefs about knowledge (epistemic beliefs) and their motivations toward processing information (epistemic motivation) have been suggested as influencing aspects of learning. This study investigated the relationship between engineering students' approach to solving an open-ended homework problem and their epistemic motivation, engineering epistemic beliefs, and epistemic cognition. The initial quantitative phase of this sequential explanatory mixed methods study employed a k-means cluster analysis to identify homogenous subgroups of biomedical engineering students based on their epistemic beliefs and epistemic motivation measured using a survey (n = 50). Eighteen of these students were interviewed to explore their epistemic cognitions when solving an open-ended homework problem. Transcripts were analyzed and results were overlaid with the clusters to investigate relationships between students' approaches to problem solving and their epistemic beliefs, motivation, and cognition. Three clusters of students were identified based on three constructs of epistemic beliefs and epistemic motivation: source of engineering knowledge, certainty of engineering knowledge, and closed-mindedness. Students in the same cluster activated similar components of epistemic cognition, such as their desired outcomes for solving the problem. Additionally, we identified that the instructor's description of the problem and how the assignment was structured influenced how students approached solving the problem. s Comparison of clusters revealed that having more constructivist epistemic beliefs does not guarantee that students will set epistemic aims or make epistemic gains. Additionally, students' approaches to solving the open-ended problem were influenced by their lack of desire to consider other ideas.

In student discourse, we found evidence for six reflective decision-making elements: articulating multiple solutions, evaluating pros and cons, intentionally selecting a solution, retelling the performance of a solution, analyzing a solution according to evidence, and purposefully choosing improvements. The discourse patterns used to enact these elements both supported and interfered with students' achievement of design goals. s Our results suggest that during engineering design tasks, young learners working in small teams can respond productively to opportunities to engage in sophisticated discourse.

This study sought to compare word-level, sentence-level, and organizational differences in writing by practitioners and students and to identify differences that are important for engineering practice. I also sought to demonstrate the untapped potential for linguistic analyses to contribute to understanding engineering writing. I used techniques from applied linguistics – corpus linguistics and rhetorical move analysis – supplemented with interviews of practitioners and students. The analysis investigated the interaction of language features, their functions, and writers' motivations. Student writing had more complicated sentence structures, less accurate word choice, more errors in grammar and punctuation, and less linear organization. These characteristics decreased effectiveness in areas that practitioners considered important: accurate and unambiguous content; fast, predicable reading; liability management; and attention to detail. Underlying the student writing problems were misconceptions about effective writing, ignorance of genre expectations, weak language skills, and a failure to appreciate that written words, not just calculations, express engineering content. s The findings better define the gap between student and practitioner writing, and are a basis for instructional materials that target important student writing weaknesses.",writing***civil engineering***professional skills***workplace practice***corpus linguistics,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jee.20161,1272

Forty-one engineering students completed an instrument that asked questions about three semiconductor phenomena after the students had observed the animated simulations. Responses were analyzed and coded using two frameworks: misconception and knowledge use. Misconceptions were prevalent for all three phenomena. Misconceptions were associated with use of incorrect prior knowledge, a combination of correct or incorrect prior knowledge, and the knowledge acquired from watching the animated simulations alone or in combination with correct and incorrect prior knowledge. Misconceptions indicated a lack of understanding of chemistry and physics concepts. s Findings indicate that students hold many misconceptions about semiconductor phenomena.

A quasi-experimental research design assessed the effectiveness of three instructional formats: engineer-led, engineer-visit, and engineer-video. Pre- and post-tests captured changes in fifth-grade students' understanding about the work of engineers and attitudes about engineering. Findings indicated significant gains in all students' understanding, with some differences across the three instructional formats. The engineer-led students did not show significant changes in overall engineering attitudes. Only the engineer-video students demonstrated significant gains in engineering job interests. s A qualitative comparison of the costs and benefits of each instructional format raised important considerations for planning engineer outreach. We recommend that engineers collaborate with science teacher educators in the design of video instruction and assist in preparing elementary classroom teachers to administer the lesson activities.",careers***elementary school***asynchronous distance learning***instructional design***engineer role models,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jee.20166,1277

Our research questions included: What discourses do faculty use to construct the meaning of student gender expression in their classroom? How do faculty discursively position themselves in relation to gender equity? What teacher identities and responsibilities do they construct through these discourses? Utilizing a feminist, poststructural epistemology and discursive methodology, we analyzed 18 interviews with instructors in three undergraduate engineering programs. After coding data for ways instructors talked about gender in their work with students, we analyzed how faculty constructed their teacher identities in relation to each discourse and how these positions affected their promotion of gender equity. Faculty used three dominant discourses to construct student gender expression and teacher identities: gender blindness, gender acknowledgment, and gender intervention. Faculty most frequently utilized discourses acknowledging gender inequity, which often limited their responsibilities to promote equity and highlights the pernicious nature of systemic gender bias. s Findings suggest that institutions could expand discourse and better align faculty awareness of gender inequity with meaningful, pedagogical change strategies.",gender***faculty***STEM***qualitative research***discourse analysis,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jee.20157,1281

Although multiple facets of the undergraduate experience significantly relate to students' self-reported leadership skills, curricular emphases on core engineering thinking, professional skills, and broad and systems perspectives explain the greatest amount of variance. The lack of significant relationships at the program level suggests a lack of formal leadership development within the undergraduate curriculum at large. s s indicate that entrusting the leadership development of undergraduate engineering students to the co-curriculum is an inefficient method of developing leadership skills for undergraduate engineers.

One potential solution for increasing the number of students completing engineering degrees in postsecondary education (PSE), and perhaps closing the gender gap in this area as well, might be through completion of engineering career and technical education (E-CTE) coursework in high school. /Hypothesis This study explores the following questions: What are the characteristics of students who take E-CTE in high school and the high schools offering these courses? How does E-CTE in high school connect to engineering degrees in PSE? Does any relationship observed differ by gender? This study utilizes the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS) to respond to these research questions. ELS provides a rich array of student and school variables including complete high school and PSE transcripts. The study uses probit regression and a random intercepts model to determine completion of the following engineering outcomes: declared engineering major, AA/AS, BA/BS, MA/MS, and PhD/Doctoral/Professional. This study found that the engineering gender gap is evident in high school, that there are observed connections between E-CTE in high school and all levels of degree except for AA/AS, and that there is a clear difference across genders as women benefitted more from E-CTE in connection to completion of an engineering BA/BS than men. s This study documents an engineering gender gap in high school and finds that participation in E-CTE can encourage completion of an engineering degree as well as potentially narrowing the engineering gender gap.",engineering pipeline***pathways***career and technical education***gender diversity***high school,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jee.20236,1291

The purpose of this paper is to gain a better understanding of how engineering students enter the engineering field by comparing commonalities across their experiences. Given recent literature that describes student dissatisfaction toward, misinformation about, and attrition in engineering programs, we explore the lived experiences of students entering the engineering field, with a particular focus on students changing their majors to engineering. This paper synthesizes the stories of 21 undergraduate engineering students from a southeastern research university, 15 of whom began their undergraduate program in other majors and transferred into engineering. We employ a unique narrative structuralizing scheme based on Campbell's hero's journey and use the metaphor of the beginning of the journey to understand student trajectories that locate students in engineering studies. s With this information, we can better understand student conceptions of the engineering field when they enter; who enters the engineering field and why; how students’ expectations are met or not in engineering programs; and what are the factors that ultimately contribute to first-year retention in engineering programs. In general, students entering engineering tend to have a limited understanding of what is entailed in an engineering program and benefit from interactions with advisors, teachers, and peers in the field. Such interactions may help students to more clearly decide what aspects of engineering are appropriate for them to pursue and help them to persist as they begin coursework.","hero's journey"", 'first-year experience***preparation***engineering pathways***student experience",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jee.20234,1292

Working Memory Load and Automaticity in Relation to Problem Solving in College Engineering Students,2018,636,655,Qian Wang***Yi Ding***Qiong Yu,Manhattan College***Fordham University***Fordham University,NA,107,4,"The overarching goal of this study was to explore the underlying mechanism of solving statics or structural analysis problems by utilizing cognitive load theory to examine task characteristics (i.e., the characteristics of instructional materials) with a focus on working memory load (WML) and automaticity. /Hypothesis According to cognitive load theory, humans have limited working memory but relatively unlimited long-term memory. Thus, we hypothesized that testing conditions with a high level of automaticity would yield better execution outcomes than those with a low level of automaticity (Hypothesis 1). We hypothesized that testing conditions with low demand on WML would be superior to those with a high demand on WML on the measures of execution outcomes (i.e., accuracy and response time; Hypothesis 2). We expected to observe the interaction between automaticity and WML by alternating the difficulty levels of the task characteristics and involving working memory through the primary task (Hypothesis 3). We utilized a 2 (two levels of WML: four steps versus five steps) × 2 (two levels of automaticity: automatized schemas enforced or not enforced) design. The participants were 31 college engineering students enrolled in a fundamental structural analysis course at a university in the northeastern United States. Findings indicate that automaticity can explain a large percentage of the variance in participants’ scores and response times; that is, despite the levels of WML, participants scored higher and performed faster under high automaticity conditions than under low automaticity conditions. WML explained a large between-subject variance in response time, but it accounted for a nonsignificant percentage of the score variance. The interaction effect between automaticity and WML on response time was statistically significant, but the interaction effect on score was not significant. Our findings are aligned with cognitive load theory and the idea that humans have limited WML. In addition, our results underscore the importance of automaticity in problem solving, especially when the task demands high WML. It appears that automaticity helps engineering learners bypass the limits of human working memory. The implications of our findings for engineering educators are also discussed.","working memory load***automaticity***problem solving***individual, computating skills",https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jee.20233,1295

We previously analyzed learning in the IVLs from a cognitive perspective, seeking to repair students' misconceptions; however, that perspective provided limited information for iteratively improving the IVLs. In this study, we shift to a sociocultural perspective to identify student learning resources activated during their engagement in the Thermodynamic Work IVL. We seek to identify the productive social and environmental triggers through which students develop conceptual ideas using technology in a social setting. Method We conducted emergent lexical coding on a cohort of 187 students' textual responses as they completed the IVL in a studio setting. We then analyzed the discursive and technology interactions of four students from different groups using video recordings. Coding results show distributions of students' activated resources. Almost all of the students demonstrated productive ideas, and almost all also revealed opportunities to learn more. Through the detailed studies, we illustrate the moment-by-moment interactions of students with one another and with technology to describe how they activate and share resources. These interactions are conceptualized and illustrated through the construct of shared resources.

No significant changes in EDA were found between individual and collaborative active learning activities. Moderate negative correlations were found between EDA and negative topic emotions in the first engineering design activity but not across the rest.

Diefes-Dux,San Jose State University***Amirkabir University of Technology***San Jose State University***Purdue University,NA,107,3,"A factor related to students’ course performance that has seen limited research compared to other academic factors is the time of day a class is offered. Because of students’ chronotypes (i.e., preferred time of day to study or work), time of class can influence attendance, which has a strong correlation with students’ performance in a course. /Hypothesis The goal of this study was to investigate the relationship between class time, students’ attendance including individual and average class attendance, and students’ final grades in an active learning course. The grade and attendance records of 1,577 first-year engineering (FYE) students enrolled in 15 sections at different times of the day were analyzed using Tukey's Honestly Significant Difference and Multi-Level Modeling to identify whether the performance and attendance of students in the early morning sections were significantly different from those in the other sections and to differentiate the individual and class attendance in relation to students’ grades. Students enrolled in early morning and late Friday afternoon classes had lower attendance and final grades than students in other sections. Class average attendance had a significant relationship with students’ grades. Thus, in active learning classes, both an individual student's and classmates’ absences have a negative relationship with an individual student's grade. FYE students are more likely to miss early morning classes. In a course based on active learning, this lower attendance has a negative relationship with student performance for all students in the class, including the ones who attend the class regularly, suggesting active learning may amplify the negative effects of missing classes.",first-year engineering***active learning***absenteeism***Multi-Level Model (MLM),https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jee.20221,1306
Development and Psychometric Testing of the Rate and Accumulation Concept Inventory,2018,491,520,Carli D. Flynn***Cliff I. Davidson***Sharon Dotger,Rochester Institute of Technology***Syracuse University***Syracuse University,NA,107,3,"Because a fundamental understanding of rate and accumulation principles is important for engineering students across all subdisciplines, a method is needed to assess their understanding of these principles. /Hypothesis This article discusses the development of the Rate and Accumulation Concept Inventory (RACI) instrument and provides an analysis of its validity and reliability. The RACI is designed to test students’ (1) overall mastery of rate and accumulation concepts and (2) mastery of specific rate and accumulation concepts (e.g., mathematics, mass flow, and heat flow). Design/ Exploratory findings of students’ conceptual understanding prompted the development of a preliminary RACI instrument. Two pilot studies were conducted, with adjustments made to the instrument between each. Data from the second pilot were used to assess evidence of validity and reliability through classical test theory, item response theory, and structural equation modeling. Validity and reliability evidence indicates that the RACI can be used to measure students’ overall understanding of the concepts identified, though several items require revision or removal. Issues of potential construct underrepresentation were found in two of the conceptual categories. s The evidence of reliability and validity indicates the appropriateness of the RACI for assessing engineering students’ overall understanding of rate and accumulation principles. Additional research is needed to further enhance the validity and reliability of the RACI as a diagnostic tool, particularly in measuring students’ understanding of rate and accumulation concepts in particular physical contexts.",concept inventories***mathematics***misconceptions***physical science***psychometric analysis,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jee.20226,1307

Qualitative researchers have also noted the importance of student agency in persistence through marginalization. Nevertheless, challenges and questions remain in identifying practices which are effective in supporting underrepresented students. The study applies scholarship from critical theory and narrative as a new resource for approaching and understanding the process of supporting marginalized student agency. Method A longitudinal interview study with a female undergraduate engineering student, Emilia, developed into a way for her to process marginalizing educational experiences and to develop new narratives that expanded her agency. After an in-depth member check, Emilia became a co-author contributing a post hoc account of the impact of these discussions. Our analysis indicates that naming one's own oppression and creating narratives that repurpose and resituate stereotypical stories of oppression was a liberatory act for Emilia. We trace three marginalizing themes of the participant's experience that are subverted and resisted through the student co-constructed narrative. s The paper builds theory for diversity support, suggesting critical theorizing may present a new form of agency not yet represented in the literature. It also points to possible value for student participants from qualitative methodologies exploring student experiences.

Work and Family Identities and Engineering Identity,2018,219,237,Ravinder Koul,The Pennsylvania State University,NA,107,2,"Women are underrepresented in engineering. Furthermore, those who enter engineering fields are less likely than men to persist. Although conflict between work and family roles has been a major explanation for this gender gap, there has been little examination of how work and family identities fit with the engineering identity of undergraduate students preparing for careers in engineering. The purpose of this study was to examine the associations between direct and indirect measures of work and family identities and engineering identity among undergraduate students in Thailand. A survey methodology was used to assess work- and family-focused hoped-for and feared possible selves, anticipated conflict between work and family roles, engineering self-concept, and intention to pursue engineering professionally. Regression analyses were used to find relationships among these measures. Findings indicate that women with balanced hoped-for and feared possible selves in both life domains of work and family reported significantly higher engineering self-concept than other women in the study. In addition, the salience of work identity and family identity was significantly and more positively related with engineering identity for women than for men. The findings indicate strong compatibility of family, work, and engineering identities for women who intended to pursue the profession.

Cox,Pennsylvania State University***The Ohio State University***The Ohio State University,NA,107,2,"Ethical issues have become increasingly important in discussions of sustainability, an area involving ethical and sociotechnical decisions that engineers may not be prepared to consider. Recent literature on engineering ethics highlights the need to integrate social and environmental aspects of ethics into technical topics through culturally sensitive and community-oriented approaches. /Hypothesis This paper explores the ethical reflections of U.S. doctoral engineering students after a two-week experience studying electronics manufacturing in India. This authentic experience is essentially a lived case study, where the students' roles were to listen and engage with a broad range of stakeholders affiliated with the electronics industry. This study used photoelicitation methods to elicit deep reflective interviews with the doctoral student participants, reporting the qualitative analysis of these interview transcripts. The concept of sustainability is typically seen as comprising the individual dimensions of economic, social, and environmental facets; however, the narratives of ethics and sustainability emerging from the interview data reported here point to the importance of the intersections among these aspects. Themes relating to safety and regulations, gender roles, and resources and waste emerged as manifestations of these intersections. s The graduate students demonstrated ethical reasoning skills related to regulations, gender roles, resources and waste, and their professional ethical responsibilities as they discussed the experiences of their trip. As students reflected on ethical tensions based on their experience, they demonstrated a deep commitment to engineering ethics, acknowledging their roles in fostering sustainability and committing to thinking about the distant stakeholders affected by engineering decisions.",graduate education***ethics***sustainability***photoelicitation,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jee.20198,1315

Libarkin,University of Michigan***University of Michigan***Michigan State University,NA,107,2,"Despite the wide adoption of entrepreneurship by United States engineering programs, there have been few advances in how to measure the influences of entrepreneurial education on engineering students. We believe the inadequate growth in engineering entrepreneurship assessment research is due to the limited use of research emerging from the broader entrepreneurship education assessment community. This paper explores entrepreneurship education assessment by documenting the current state of the research and identifying the theories, variables, and research designs most commonly used by the broader community. We then examine if and how these theories and constructs are used in engineering entrepreneurship education. Scope/Method Two literature databases, Scopus® and Proquest, were searched systematically for entrepreneurship education assessment research literature. This search yielded 2,841 unique papers. Once inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied, 359 empirical research papers were coded for study design, theory, variables measured, instruments, and validity and reliability. s While there has been growth in entrepreneurship education assessment research, little exchange of ideas across the disciplines of business, engineering, and education is occurring. Nonempirical descriptions of programs outweigh empirical research, and these empirical studies focus on affective, rather than cognitive or behavioral, outcomes. This pattern within the larger entrepreneurship community is mirrored in engineering where the use of theory-based, validated entrepreneurship education assessment instruments generally focuses on the context of intent to start a new company. Given the engineering community's goals to support engineering entrepreneurship beyond business creation, the engineering education community should consider developing assessment instruments based in theory and focused on engineering-specific entrepreneurship outcomes.",entrepreneurship***research methods***systematic review***theoretical frameworks***student assessment,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jee.20197,1316
What Drives Engineering Students To Be Entrepreneurs? Evidence of Validity for an Entrepreneurial Motivation Scale,2018,291,317,Soohyun Yi***Nathalie Duval-Couetil,Purdue University***Purdue University,NA,107,2,"Educators and policymakers are increasingly interested in making entrepreneurship education accessible to engineering students given engineers' potential contributions to innovation and the economy. However, what motivates engineering students to choose entrepreneurial careers and how this could be influenced through education have not been fully explored in the literature. The study develops and tests an entrepreneurial motivation scale for engineering students. It required providing initial evidence of validity for the scale based on guidelines for developing educational and psychological tests. Following a comprehensive literature review, we chose to modify an existing scale and administer it to engineering students. Here we present two sources of evidence of validity for examining how entrepreneurial motivation relates to variables commonly used to measure the impact of entrepreneurship education. They were developed by examining factor structure and psychometric properties as well as conducting mediation analysis. Data obtained from 460 engineering students supported three factors underlying the construct of entrepreneurial motivation: Motivation for Creation and Solution (MCS), Motivation for Personal Interests (MPS), and Managerial Motivation (MM). MCS and MM effectively explained intention to become an entrepreneur with mediation effects of venturing and technology self-efficacy. These findings resulted in a more parsimonious categorization of factors underlying the construct of entrepreneurial motivation than identified in prior studies, providing a foundational understanding of entrepreneurial motivation among engineering students. The results can be useful in assessment, research, and/or policy decisions related to delivering entrepreneurship education to engineering students.",motivation***entrepreneurship***validity***factor analysis***structural equation modeling,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jee.20199,1317

Data from first-time, full-time engineering undergraduates at a large Midwestern university were collected at Weeks 1 and 13 of the first semester. Analyses were replicated across two cohorts (2013 and 2014). On average, students entered and ended the semester with relatively incremental and positive effort beliefs. Surprisingly, incremental beliefs did not predict grade point average (GPA). Positive effort beliefs were associated with GPA in both cohorts. Findings regarding the role that perceived effort plays in achievement were replicated across cohorts. The average trajectory was as follows: at Week 1, students perceived that ability/intelligence was the primary contributor to high school achievement but anticipated that effort would play a greater role in undergraduate coursework; at Week 13, students on average reflected that the role of effort was less than originally anticipated. Although implicit beliefs about intelligence and effort beliefs remained fairly stable across the first semester, students in both cohorts exhibited similar shifts in perceptions of the importance of effort (relative to ability/intelligence) for academic success.",motivation***first year***achievement,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jee.20187,1323

These critiques can be addressed by rethinking student integration and its use in the context of engineering education. /Hypothesis This article re-conceptualizes student integration and describes the development of the Engineering Student Integration Instrument (ESII), which measures integration, as well as provides evidence of its validity. Preliminary items for the ESII were developed using open-ended survey responses from undergraduate engineering students about the impact of co-curricular support.

The resulting instrument was administered electronically to students in the College of Engineering at a large East Coast public university. Data from 586 students were used to develop evidence of validity by conducting an exploratory factor analysis on half of the data and a confirmatory factor analysis on the other half. Evidence of validity indicates the appropriateness of the ESII for measuring integration and operationalizes integration constructs from the model of co-curricular support (MCCS) for undergraduate engineering students, including academic, social, professional, and university integration. s Grounded in the MCCS, the ESII begins to address several critiques of student integration as originally defined by Tinto's model of institutional departure, those related particularly to the measurement of the integration constructs.",student development***integration***validity***assessment tools,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jee.20184,1324

In 2006, Ray McDermott and Hervé Varenne called for examining the “cultural construction” of educational problems, uncovering how multiple actors create and inscribe meaning to the educational problem. We apply the cultural construction framework to examine how the educational problem of a student being “not cut out for engineering” is constructed within the context of a specific electrical engineering course. We focus on culturally taken-for-granted course structures, practices, and interactions, all of which produce the local enactment of this common educational problem. Method We used ethnographic methods, including field-noted participant observations, one-on-one participant interviews, and video-recorded student work on lab assignments. Coordinating multiple data streams enabled us to question explanations couched in terms of individual ability and background, and to illustrate how ability hierarchies were constructed in the educational context. Our findings illustrate how several mundane and seemingly innocuous aspects of engineering classrooms add up to construct the educational problem of our focal student as “not cut out” for engineering. Contributions to this construction included lecture seating positions, interactional norms in lecture and lab, and labels made meaningful through institutional and interactional processes. s The forces at play in constructing educational problems for students are deeply embedded in institutions, disciplines, and society, making it difficult to generate a simple list of instructional interventions.

Interviews with engineering students (n = 9) about engineering problems, problem solving processes, their futures, and interactions between their futures and problem solving tasks were analyzed using interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA). Analysis of the resulting transcripts identified and clustered units of meaning into themes, first by participant and then across participants. Three themes emerged from the IPA: participants perceived engineering as being primarily a problem solving process; participants reported using different problem solving processes depending on how well the task aligned with their future goals; and participants' perceptions of their future drove the problem solving processes they report using. s This work supports and extends engineering problem solving literature by making explicit the connections students describe between their problem solving processes and their future-oriented motivations.

Vosniadou's framework theory explains conceptual change in terms of how students learn to relate the observable and unobservable in everyday phenomena. As a result, courses that relate physical phenomena to complex abstractions – such as Mechanics of Materials – are useful spaces for exploring conceptual change. This paper leverages Vosniadou's framework theory of conceptual change to explore students' reasoning and to identify trends about their understanding of fundamental concepts of mechanics of materials. This research is based on the qualitative analysis of semi-structured interviews with ninety engineering undergraduate students enrolled in a Mechanics of Materials course. Interviews were qualitatively analyzed to capture students' understanding of mechanics of materials concepts under different loading scenarios. Our results found two common persistent beliefs in student reasoning in both the axial and bending load cases: that shear and normal stress depend on (a) the direction and (b) the location of an applied load. We propose that students' “nonscientific” beliefs are part of an intermediate, synthetic model of conceptual understanding created as students assimilate their presuppositions of mechanics of materials with newly acquired information based on the scientific concepts. s Students form naïve conceptual beliefs based on their experiences with loading scenarios that impede their abilities to more effectively assimilate new concepts into their current framework theories.

The Naturalistic Observations of Metacognition in Engineering (NOME) Observational Protocol and Coding Strategy is a qualitative data collection method that allows researchers to observe the behaviors of students who are studying in groups to determine the student's engagement in different metacognitive practices. The NOME is intended to be used by researchers interested in studying online metacognitive behaviors without the direct interference of a methodological approach. We observed three study groups where students were working on an engineering problem-solving homework assignment. Using a taxonomic definition of metacognition, we coded episodes of observation transcripts to identify behaviors that represented key definitions in the taxonomy. We combined subcodes and descriptions of behaviors with key definitions to develop a coding strategy useful for future observational studies. Evidence of intercoder agreement and agreement in unitizing indicates that the coding strategy can reliably be used by multiple trained coders to identify metacognitive engagement. s The reliability evidence shows that the NOME may be a useful tool for researchers in engineering education interested in studying the metacognitive habits of engineering students in self-directed study.",coding strategy***metacognition***observations***reliability,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jee.20291,1335

The impact of flipped classrooms on student achievement in engineering education: A meta-analysis of 10 years of research,2019,523,546,Chung Kwan Lo***Khe Foon Hew,"Faculty of Education, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam Hong Kong***Faculty of Education, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam Hong Kong",NA,108,4,"The flipped classroom has become more widely used in engineering education. However, a systematic and quantitative assessment of its achievement outcomes has not been conducted to date. To address this gap, we examined the findings from comparative articles published between 2008 and 2017 through a meta-analysis to summarize the overall effects of the flipped classroom on student achievement in engineering education. Scope/Method We searched and analyzed journal and conference publications on flipped classroom studies in engineering education in K-12 and higher education contexts. Twenty-nine comparative interventions were included in a meta-analysis involving 2,590 students exposed to flipped classroom and 2,739 students exposed to traditional lectures. A content analysis was also conducted to determine how the flipped engineering classroom benefits student learning. s The meta-analysis comparing these 29 traditional—flipped interventions in relation to student achievement showed an overall significant effect in favor of the flipped classroom over traditional lecturing (Hedges' g = 0.289, 95% CI [0.165, 0.414], p < .001). A moderator analysis showed that the effect of the flipped classroom was further enhanced when instructors offered a brief review at the start of face-to-face classes. Our qualitative findings suggest that self-paced learning and more problem-solving activities were the two most frequently reported benefits that promoted student learning. Based on quantitative and qualitative support, several implications are identified for future practice, such as offering a brief in-class review of preclass materials. Some recommendations for future research are also provided.",achievement***flipped classroom***meta-analysis***systematic review,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jee.20293,1337
Impact of a prototyping intervention on middle school students' iterative practices and reactions to failure,2019,547,573,Jenna Marks***Catherine C. Chase,Teachers College Columbia University New York New York***Teachers College Columbia University New York New York,NA,108,4,"Design thinking, with its emphasis on iterative prototyping and mantra of “fail early and often,” stands in stark contrast to the typical one-and-done, failure-averse culture of the classroom. Iterative prototyping and fail-forward mindsets could promote valuable iterative practices and positive reactions to failure, but little research has examined their impact in K-12 contexts. In two studies, we investigated the effect of a brief prototyping intervention on students' iterative knowledge, desires, and behaviors; self-reported reactions to failure; and performance on a design challenge. Study participants included 78 and 89 students in grades five and six, respectively. Students in an iterative prototyping condition (Prototype) were taught the process and fail-forward mindset of iterative prototyping. In a comparative, content-focused condition (Content), students focused on using science and math concepts in design. In both studies, Prototype students gained greater knowledge of iterative prototyping, reported a greater desire to iterate, and engaged in more iterative behaviors on a novel, unsupported design challenge than Content students. In Study 2, students in the Prototype condition reported more positive affect and actions in reaction to failure and produced more successful designs than their Content counterparts. However, regardless of condition, students who iterated earlier created more successful designs. s These studies provide an existence proof that instruction on the iterative prototyping process and mindset can encourage students to try early and often and promote healthier reactions to failure.

This trend may have implications both for the design of interventions to improve student learning and for data analysis to detect collaborative cheating. /Hypothesis We hypothesize that average exam scores decline over the exam period primarily due to self-selection effects, where weaker students tend to choose exam times later in the exam period, while stronger students are more likely to choose earlier times. We collected 31,673 exam records over four semesters from six undergraduate engineering and computing courses that had both synchronous exams (all students at the same time) and asynchronous exams (students choose a time). We analyzed student exam time choice and asynchronous exam scores, using synchronous exam scores in the same course as a control variable. We find that students with lower scores on synchronous exams generally elect to take asynchronous exams later and that controlling for student ability (via synchronous exams) removes 70% of the decline observed in average asynchronous exam scores over the exam period but does not eliminate the downward trend with time. s We conclude that self-selection effects are primarily responsible for exam score declines over time, that exam time selection is unlikely to be a useful target for interventions to improve performance, and that there is no evidence for widespread collaborative cheating in the dataset used in this research.",asynchronous***undergraduate***test format (syn: Exam format)***automated grading,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jee.20292,1339

Students with “high potential” for developing this attribute who aspired to help others with their disciplines acknowledged social suffering. While both those with an equity ethic and those with high potential saw inequities as socially caused, those with an equity ethic reported more impactful experiences with social suffering, resulting in greater empathy and responsibility to respond. Several students described neither altruistic nor social justice concerns (students with low potential) and did not experience social suffering directly or indirectly.

Design-based research was conducted in a sixth-grade classroom. Students used a type of Improvable Model, specifically the Suboptimal System (SS) seed model. Improvable Models make the entire design space accessible and enable iterative design optimization. An SS seed model represents inefficient design decisions and is used as an initiator for iterative design optimization. The study spanned 10 lessons, each 45 min long, totaling 8 days of instructional activity spread across 1 month. Data sources included student conversations, design work, and presentations. The productive disciplinary engagement framework was used to analyze the data. Students used the seed model for productively engaging with five disciplinary practices: decomposing the design challenge into individual design parameters, considering the relationship between design parameters, reasoning through multiple design parameters and making trade-offs, weighing multiple solutions, and using design heuristics for ideation and design optimization. The seed model scaffolded students' productive engagement in various disciplinary practices such as informed decision-making and systematic exploration.

More specifically, a corpus-assisted discourse analysis of relevant engineering education articles published in leading academic journals between 2000 and 2015 was combined with a close reading of each and a critical discussion of two representative articles. Our findings reveal that, first, intercultural communication has not received the attention it deserves, given the multidisciplinary, diverse, global nature of the engineering profession.

This approach has been criticized for reinforcing stereotypical thinking and offering simplistic answers to complex problems. s We conclude by exploring reasons for the relatively wide-spread acceptance of the “culture-as-given” approach in engineering education, then by urging educators to adopt a “small culture” approach for constructing culture in engineering, and finally by suggesting alternative ways for developing intercultural communicative competence.",culture***discourse analysis***inclusivity***intercultural competence***interdisciplinarity,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jee.20254,1357

Learning from small numbers: Studying ruling relations that gender and race the structure of U.S. engineering education,2019,13,31,Alice L. Pawley,"School of Engineering Education, Purdue University West Lafayette Indiana",NA,108,1,"Women and men of color and White women participate in American engineering education in lower proportions than they represent in the general U.S. population. Much existing engineering education research uses individual-level (such as psychological) theories to explain this difference. The study reported here instead takes a structural perspective, asking how social relations are coordinated in engineering education. This study explores how the intersection of ruling relations, critical race, and feminist theories can investigate how gender and race are built into engineering education's institutional structure. This study used interviews collected from 17 women and men of color and White women who were engineering undergraduate students at U.S. universities. The interviews were drawn from a project that takes as its premise that learning from such small numbers of students facilitates analyzing data intersectionally. The primary analysis used narrative methods through repeated readings. I offer empirically based illustrations of ruling relations in U.S. universities and schools of engineering that unduly impact minoritized populations. These illustrations include discussions of financial aid knowledge, meeting the needs of transfer and Native students, and how schools crafting “the ideal student” as a young, single White male problematically impact minoritized students. The results illustrate how ruling relations structure engineering education in White- and male-dominated ways. s This paper offers questions to help readers consider how ruling relations race and gender their own institutions. In addition, it offers an interpretive, emergent method for interrogating institutional structure and ideas for future work using ruling relations in engineering education research.",critical theory***gender***institutional structure***race***ruling relations,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jee.20247,1369

It includes 111,925 engineering students from 11 U.S. universities, including first-time-in-college and transfer students who ever majored in the most common engineering disciplines: chemical, civil, electrical, industrial, and mechanical engineering. Contemporary data visualization methods are used to display quantitative data and clarify their complexity. This work captures the intersectionality of race/ethnicity, sex, and discipline with metrics that are new or little used, such as stickiness (retention by a discipline), migrator graduation rate, and migration yield (attraction of a discipline). Using these metrics, we uncover information about the success of students who migrate between and among the top five engineering disciplines. s Stickiness, migrator graduation rates, and migration yield metrics coupled with contemporary data visualization methods provide insights into the student experience not afforded by the conventional pipeline and pathways models.

Over 8 years, 3,097 (27%) engineering students participated in one or more STEP activities including a residential college, a student mentoring program, an introductory engineering design course, and a summer bridge camp for first-year students. This paper describes the influence of the STEP activities on persistence, while accounting for demographic and academic preparation variables. Data collected over 8 years from first-year engineering students include demographics, academic preparation, participation in STEP activities, and yearly status regarding major and graduation. Descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and multiple logistic regression determine which factors significantly impact persistence in engineering majors, in STEM majors, and in all majors at LSU. STEP participants have higher persistence levels than nonparticipants by at least 11% in engineering, 9% in STEM, and 5% in all majors at LSU.

We hypothesized that students' ethical reasoning abilities and empathic perspective-taking tendencies would increase. We implemented and tested the integrated approach over five semesters with graduate-level engineering students through a quasi-experimental, controlled research design. We measured changes in ethical reasoning using the Engineering Ethical Reasoning Instrument (EERI) and the Defining Issues Test 2 (DIT2) and empathic tendencies using the Interpersonal Reactivity Index (IRI). We examined relationships among measures through correlation analysis. The EERI instrumentation indicated that the approach significantly increased the ethical reasoning abilities of graduate-level engineering students. However, the DIT2 findings did not indicate change. The IRI indicated perspective-taking tendencies were enhanced and personal distress tendencies were reduced. Postcourse correlational data indicated moderate relationships between perspective-taking and ethical reasoning as measured by the IRI and the EERI indexes. s This study provides a theoretical approach for developing ethical reasoning and empathic perspective-taking among graduate-level engineering students.

Students in both nonflipped and flipped settings completed a web-based Comprehensive Assessment of Team Member Effectiveness (CATME) SMARTER Teamwork survey. A series of ANCOVAs and path analyses were conducted to gain insights into team dynamics in both course environments. Although no significant differences in team conflict were found, significantly higher levels of team member satisfaction and peer assessment rates were detected in the flipped course. The path analysis revealed relationships among team conflict, team member satisfaction, and peer assessment in both course versions. Differences in relationships among the unidimensional levels of team conflict and the other two variables were found between the nonflipped and flipped versions. s The primary pedagogical implication of this research points to the affordance of the flipped course setting in providing sufficient time for student members to become cohesive teams.

In fact, many undergraduate courses focus on developing students' knowledge and understanding of core engineering concepts. At the same time, a growing body of literature points to substantial gaps across educational and professional practice contexts, including how problems are embodied and solved. The purpose of this study was to explore potential differences in conceptual understanding across engineering students and professional engineers. To do so, we compared the responses of civil engineering practitioners to the Statics Concept Inventory (SCI) to those of engineering students enrolled in statics courses. We administered the SCI to 95 practicing civil engineers and compared their responses to an existing dataset from 1,372 engineering students. We conducted three comparisons: overall SCI score, concept subscores, and item-by-item. Students generally outperformed engineers on the SCI in terms of overall performance. However, on closer inspection, students' superior performance appears to be driven by differences in knowledge or understanding of specific statics concepts rather than a stronger understanding in general. s We caution against interpretations that imply students have a better understanding of statics concepts. Instead, our results suggest that differences in the way concepts are situated and applied across school and workplace contexts might account for the differences in the performance observed. These findings raise critical questions regarding the nature of concepts and the immutability of common academic representations, and point to the need for further qualitative and exploratory work investigating concepts in practice.",assessment tools***concept inventories***concepts in practice***conceptual understanding***professional practice,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jee.20246,1374
Cover Image,2020,NA,NA,na,na,NA,109,4,"Description of Graphic on the cover of the October issue of JEE 109(4) Professoriate Bound: Online Coaching for Black Engineering Scholars Ann Varnedoe 1, Dara E. Naphan-Kingery 2, Ebony O. McGee 1, and William H. Robinson 1 1 Explorations in Diversifying Engineering Faculty Initiative (EDEFI), Vanderbilt University, Nashville, TN 2 Department of Social Sciences and Cultural Studies, Western New Mexico University, Silver City, NM Professoriate Bound is a gender-identity and race-conscious virtual coaching program that focuses on the necessity of diversifying the professoriate within the field of engineering and computer science. Through research backed measures (Robinson, McGee, Bentley, Houston & Botchway, 2016; McGee, White, Jenkins, Houston, Bentley, Smith & Robinson, 2016; Naphan-Kingery, Ridgeway, Brockman, McKane, Botchway & McGee, 2019), two Black faculty members guide participants through an 11-session coaching program. The faculty members are assigned to coach a group of two to three Black doctoral students from the disciplines of engineering or computer science; the program assists these students as they navigate the process of successfully completing their PhD and enter the professional world. Each coaching pair consists of one engineering faculty member and one social science faculty member. In addition to providing professional development, the overall goal of Professoriate Bound was to provide participants with a virtual counterspace—a “safe space” that is separate from mainstream educational spaces and occupied by other minoritized students (Ong, Smith & Ko, 2018; Solórzano, Ceja & Yosso, 2000), where they could have a sense of belonging and safety while sharing their narratives. Moreover, we wanted to provide participants with a better idea of what academic life is like as a Black engineer and more generally as a Black faculty member. Thus, we expected that these spaces would also foreground the centrality of race and racism as social structures by discussing pertinent social science knowledge, but that they would also serve as counterspaces in which the participants could prioritize and center their personal, experiential knowledge. As the spaces existed virtually, the students were able to participate in their individual doctoral programs while also having this online community where their identities and experiences could be affirmed. One participant explained: “I didn't realize how much that my identity plays into my growth and development as a graduate student. There are so many times that I switch between being a Black engineer or being an engineer who happens to be Black. This helped me see that it is normal to feel this way.” Currently, the landscape of Engineering and Computing for Black faculty lags far behind the representation of other racial groups. Over the past ten years, Black faculty in engineering departments have made up between 2% – 2.7% of the tenured faculty members (Roy, 2019). The goal of this program is to provide the tangible steps necessary for Black PhD students to successfully obtain tenure-track positions through personalized coaching. In addition to providing students with this critical space for professional development, students are given a form of social support through their peers in the program. Professoriate Bound just completed both its second cohort and an extension of the program that was created to support members of the first cohort as they continued their professional journey. The successes of the program have been detailed through both the professional achievements of our participants and the qualitative data we have collected that speak to the importance of this counterspace.

We described the general and engineering mindsets of students in fifth-grade U.S. classrooms (ages 10 and 11) who received engineering instruction. We explored how general mindsets may predict engineering learning outcomes and how engineering mindsets may be predicted by general mindset and other variables. We collected General Mindset (GM) and Engineering Mindset (EM) surveys from 2,086 fifth graders. We analyzed and correlated their GM and EM scores and survey item responses. Using hierarchical linear modeling, we measured the contribution of GM to models predicting EM and engineering learning outcomes and identified factors that predicted EM. Almost three quarters of students who submitted EM surveys agreed with a growth mindset. Students with higher GM scores had higher engineering postassessment scores. Those who had a higher socioeconomic status did not receive special education services, experienced more whole-class discussion and activity, or had a higher GM score were more likely to have a more growth-minded EM score. s Engineering education should help students see that they can grow in their capacities to engineer.

Our findings illuminate inequality in enrollment in engineering programs at four-year institutions across high schools by gender, race, and socioeconomic status (and the intersections among those demographics). Different high schools have different engineering enrollment rates among students who attend four-year postsecondary institutions.

In this study, we investigate the effects of prompting novice students to draw when solving problems, a professional practice of engineers. We investigate whether implementing instructional prompts to draw in an active learning classroom (a) increases students' use and value of drawing as a problem-solving strategy and (b) enhances students' problem-solving performance. Method We compared survey data and exam scores collected in one undergraduate class that received prompts to draw in video lectures and in-class problems (drawing condition) and one class that received no drawing prompts (control condition).

We tested the effectiveness of schema training and explored the nature of challenging concepts from thermodynamics and heat transfer. We investigated if schema training could (a) repair misconceptions in advanced engineering students and (b) prevent them in beginning engineering students. Method We adapted Slotta and Chi's schema training modules and tested their impact in two studies that employed an experimental design. Items from the Thermal and Transport Concept Inventory and expert-developed multiple-choice questions were used to evaluate conceptual understanding of the participants. The language used by students in their open-ended explanations of multiple-choice questions was also coded. In both studies, students in the experimental groups showed larger gains in their understanding of some concepts—specifically in dye diffusion and microfluidics in Study One, and in the final test for thermodynamics in Study Two. But in neither study did students exhibit any gain in conceptual questions about heat transfer.

Teams perceived stakeholder specific interactions to be more useful when they prespecified a goal for the interaction, interacted with stakeholders who had specific subject matter expertise, or ceded control of the decision-making process to stakeholders. Students perceived interactions to be less useful when information gathered varied across stakeholders or when information was not directly applicable to the design decision at hand. s The factors this study identified that influenced students' perceptions of the usefulness of stakeholder interactions elucidate specific challenges students encounter when engaging with stakeholders.

However, little is known about the perceptions of research or researchers that students develop through these experiences. Understanding these perceptions will provide insight into how students come to understand knowledge evaluation and creation, while allowing research advisors to better support student development. In this paper, we explore how undergraduate engineering students perceive what it means to do research and be a researcher, using identity and epistemic cognition as sensitizing concepts. Our goal is to explore students' views of UREs to make the benefits of these experiences more accessible. We created and adapted open-ended survey items from previously published studies. We collected responses from mechanical and biomedical engineering undergraduates at five institutions (n = 154) and used an inductive approach to analyze responses. We developed four salient themes from our analysis: (a) research results in discovery, (b) research includes dissemination such as authorship, (c) research findings are integrated into society, and (d) researchers demonstrate self-regulation. s The four themes highlight factors that students perceive as part of a researcher identity and aspects of epistemic cognition in the context of UREs.

Current evaluation of engineering internship courses in higher education relies mainly on surveys developed independently by the internship coordinator which are seldom validated. The purpose of this study was to validate a newly adapted version of the Work Experience Questionnaire (WEQ), which can be used for evaluating engineering students' perception of their internship experience. The questionnaire was administered to 271 engineering students from one university in Hong Kong. To provide evidence on reliability and validity, exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis were performed to examine the psychometric properties of the instrument. Exploratory factor analysis resulted in four factors: clear goals, workplace support, university support, and generic competencies. Confirmatory factor analyses demonstrated that the correlated four-factor model provided an acceptable fit with the data. Cronbach's alpha indicated that the four scales were reliable. The four-factors are also pragmatic in the engineering context. s This study reviewed and provided reliability and validity evidence of key constructs in the WEQ in a single disciplinary (i.e., engineering) context and also in the Hong Kong context.

Burt,Department of Educational Policy and Leadership Analysis in the School of Education University of Wisconsin-Madison Madison Wisconsin USA,NA,109,4,"Given the significant roles that faculty play, it is important to understand how and why engineering graduate students choose faculty careers over other professional opportunities. Yet little is known about this decision-making process, particularly for students of color. This article offers a rich, empirically grounded account of the development of one graduate student's professorial intentions as a launch-point from which to explore how to broaden participation in the professoriate among underrepresented students of color in engineering. Method Narrative data were analyzed chronologically and thematically to investigate the influences that help explain Allen's professorial intentions. This study foregrounds Allen's meaning-making pertaining to how his educational experiences and various identities shaped his evolving understandings of the professoriate and of his suitability for a faculty career. Allen's journey describes a trajectory from disinterest to interest in the professoriate through his evolving understandings of the academy and the professoriate, the development of a faculty prototype and its role in his thinking about faculty norms and roles, and finally, envisioning himself in the professoriate. s The underrepresentation of historically marginalized individuals among engineering faculty will remain a problem until more knowledge is gained about why students choose to pursue the engineering professoriate.

However, these constructs have often been studied separately, despite theorized and demonstrated connections between students' identity and motivation in other fields. /Hypothesis Our study fills this gap by investigating the connections between identity and motivation. We specifically examined the connections between students' engineering role identity and future-time perspective (FTP; a theory of human motivation) theories to understand students' interest in choosing an engineering major after their first year, which we call continuing engineering major interest. Design/ The data came from a questionnaire distributed during Fall 2015 (n = 2,879). Structural equation modeling was used to understand the connections between the latent factors of engineering role identity and FTP. We also examined the predictive validity of this model on students' continuing engineering major interest. Our results show connections between students' engineering role identity and the domain-specific constructs of FTP. Identity was fully mediated by students' FTPs, and these perspectives were important for predicting continuing major interest. Engineering role identity measures explained a combined 69% of the variance in the FTP measures, and engineering role identity and FTP measures together explained 14.2% of the variance in engineering major interest. s These findings provide empirical evidence for linking identity and motivation in studies of engineering students' career pathways.

A spatial ability test, a set of math word problems and an accompanying math ability test, was administered to two samples of first-year engineering students in two countries. Data were analyzed at the test level to evaluate the relationship of spatial ability to problem representation and solution. A detailed item level analysis was conducted to compare approach to problem-solving with spatial ability level. Spatial ability was found to be significantly related to problem-solving but not to the math ability test, indicating the relationship was limited to the problem representation phase, not the solution phase. Key aspects of representation were identified for each problem to reveal a more pronounced relationship between representation and spatial ability than between problem-solving (representation and solution) and spatial ability. s Problem-solving can be considered to consist of two cognitively distinct phases: problem representation and problem solution. It was found that spatial ability is significantly related to problem representation but not to problem solution.

However, at times they have trouble accessing information from these representations due to the way information is encoded in features of the representation.

We synthesized findings from two of our prior research studies using the constant comparative method. We described the effect of representations on students' ability to access and use domain knowledge during problem-solving within and across engineering disciplines. We identified three themes that describe how visual representations affect students’ reasoning. First, students conflated concepts that were represented using similar features. Second, students consistently failed to use concepts that were not represented with visually salient features. Third, statics students coordinated multiple representations when translating between representations during problem-solving more often than the digital logic students. s These themes provide possible domain-general pathways for redesigning the notation and representations that we use to teach engineering concepts and suggest future avenues of research to further explore the generality of these findings.",conceptual learning***constant comparative method***qualitative***STEM***undergraduate research***visual representations,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jee.20348,1402

The main aim of this article is to describe how the SJT was developed through a systematic multistep process. Secondarily, we explore relationships between SJT performance and other theoretically relevant variables. After generating a large initial pool of SJT scenarios and behavioral response items, we used ratings from subject matter experts (SMEs) to select six SJT scenarios and create scoring keys for 26 response items. To further explore the instrument's validity, we deployed the SJT items, other relevant measures, and a demographic survey to a sample of practicing engineers (n = 400). SME ratings provide strong evidence for the content relevance of the GEC–SJT tool. Survey results also suggest positive relationships between SJT performance and Chinese cultural knowledge, age, and years of work experience. However, more validity and reliability evidence is needed before recommending wider use of the instrument. s Our findings suggest the SJT format as a promising behavior-based approach to measuring global competency and other professional attributes in engineering.

Growing evidence suggests that participation in out-of-school maker activities—a class of informal design and build activities—holds promise to help youth gain interest and skill in engineering design. /Hypothesis This study investigates how youth learn engineering design through participation in a maker club. It is theoretically grounded in Sfard's (2008) commognition framework, an approach that views learning to be an engineer as learning to participate in engineering discourse. The study employed case study methods of interaction analysis of video-recorded observations. The analysis closely examines interactions to uncover the mechanisms of discourse development. Findings showed that a newcomer to the discourse could show substantive growth within a single work session. The analysis examined how the youth and a mentor collaborated within a hands-on learning environment to create opportunities for discourse development. Such growth is not inevitable as seen in an analysis of a missed opportunity. s This article shows that making can be a fruitful context for the development of engineering discourse, and it illustrates mechanisms through which that learning can occur, including explorative imitation of engineering discourse routines within hands-on learning environments. It shows that professional engineers can play an important role in youth learning.",communication***design***informal learning***making***mentoring,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jee.20311,1415

Compared with the United States and other European Union countries, this underrepresentation is particularly pronounced in the United Kingdom. While existing literature gives insights into factors shaping retention and progression in university engineering students, comparatively less is known about the development of primary and secondary school students' engineering aspirations. This paper contrasts science and engineering analyses to explore how relationships between background and attitudinal factors and aspirations change across primary and secondary schools. We examine the relative influence of gender on aspirations in both science and engineering. We drew on survey data from more than 20,000 English students from the ASPIRES projects. A multilevel regression approach is implemented to test for the effects of gender, ethnicity, and cultural capital on science and engineering aspirations. Gender is the main factor related to engineering aspirations, while science aspirations are influenced by a broader range of factors. School-level factors become increasingly important for engineering aspirations. We also report evidence of the early distinctiveness of young women who aspire to engineering in terms of their relatively high self-concept and motivations. s The association of engineering with masculinity is evident in aspirations from age 10, and students aspiring to engineering are distinctive in several respects.

We note that whether identities are relatively marginalized, privileged, hidden, or apparent in a research context creates complexities for conceptualizing, practicing, and disclosing one's positionality. Method In a collaborative inquiry informed by autoethnography, we assemble positionality reflections of current engineering education researchers to demonstrate the primary ways in which positionality impacts research. We find that positionality impacts six fundamental aspects of research: research topic, epistemology, ontology, methodology, relation to participants, and communication. These aspects of research delve deeper than conceptions of positionality as a methodological limitation, a measure to prevent bias, or a requirement for research quality. The impact of positionality on research is complex, particularly when researchers occupy minoritized identities and for research topics that interrogate power relations between identity groups.

The results of this study suggest that engineering identity development alone does not contribute to the retention of Black women in the engineering workplace but instead the confluence of race, gender, and role identity that aids in developing a resilient engineering identity. s The formal, informal, and structural educational experiences of Black women engineers are critical to the development of a resilient engineering identity. This identity is dependent on the complexities associated with being Black, a woman, and an engineer.",diversity concerns***engineering profession***identity***race/ethnicity***retention,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jee.20374,1441
Shifts in elementary teachers' pedagogical reasoning: Studying teacher learning in an online graduate program in engineering education,2021,252,271,Jessica Watkins***Merredith Portsmore***Rebecca D. Swanson,Department of Teaching and Learning Vanderbilt University Nashville Tennessee USA***Center for Engineering Education and Outreach Tufts University Medford Massachusetts USA***Center for Engineering Education and Outreach Tufts University Medford Massachusetts USA,NA,110,1,"Elementary educators are increasingly asked to teach engineering design, motivating study of how they learn to teach this discipline. In particular, there is a need to examine how teachers reason about pedagogical situations and dilemmas in engineering—how they draw on their disciplinary understandings, attention to students' thinking, and pedagogical practices to support students' learning. /Hypothesis The purpose of our qualitative study was to examine elementary teachers' pedagogical reasoning in an online graduate program. We asked: What stances do teachers take toward learning and teaching engineering design? How do these stances shift over the course of the program? We identified two teachers, Alma and Margaret, who exhibited productive shifts in their pedagogical reasoning during the program. Drawing on interviews and videos of their teaching, we developed case studies characterizing their stances toward teaching and learning engineering. Alma shifted in her reasoning about teaching the design process, from treating it as linear, discrete steps to recognizing the dynamic, overlapping nature of design practices. Similarly, Margaret shifted in how she reasoned about failure and iteration, recognizing the need to help students analyze unexpected design performances to learn from and iterate on their designs. For both teachers, these shifts were dynamic and nonlinear, reflecting both context-sensitivity and growing stability in their reasoning. s Engineering teacher educators should provide opportunities for teachers to reason about the specific pedagogical dilemmas in engineering and consider how teachers integrate disciplinary understandings with attention to students' reasoning and actions and pedagogical practices.",case study***distance learning***elementary school***pedagogy***teacher education,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jee.20369,1448
