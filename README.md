Gray UR NLP Project

 NLP + Sentiment Analysis + Fine-tuning
 
This project demonstrates backend development for sentiment analysis of student feedback, using preprocessing pipelines, model fine-tuning, and hyperparameter optimization. It highlights applied Natural Language Processing (NLP) skills and practical machine learning experimentation.

Repository Contents

sample_code/
Contains small example snippets and utilities used to test preprocessing pipelines and sentiment analysis workflows.

catme_sentimental_example_new/
Demonstrates sentiment analysis applied to student peer-evaluation comments (CATME dataset). Includes preprocessing, sentiment labeling, and basic model evaluation.

Fine_tune_HyperparameterOptimization/
Contains code to fine-tune models using hyperparameter optimization. This includes grid/random search and experiment tracking to identify optimal configurations for sentiment classification tasks.

Data Privacy Notice

 Important:
The original project used datasets containing text from students and professors. These datasets have been intentionally deleted from this public repository to protect the privacy of individuals.

Only the code remains here so that recruiters and collaborators can review the backend workflows.

If you wish to reproduce the results, you will need to supply your own datasets with a similar structure.

Getting Started

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Trisheka3204/Gray-UR-NLP-Project.git


Install the dependencies listed in each script (requirements may include scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, transformers, etc.).

Run the scripts within their respective folders to reproduce experiments with your own datasets.
