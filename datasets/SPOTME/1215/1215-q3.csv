I know it's early but have some pep in you voice!
he can offer more visual materials in classes
I really enjoyed having Dr. Gray as a teacher he really tried to make each class interesting and enjoyable.

This course was challenging and interesting and taught me about different types of engineering.
Good teacher.
I do not think I understand the objective of this course.
Excellent teacher
He's a really good teacher like really good
For a lot of the assignments the instructions were very vague. I don't know if that was intentional by the department so that we would critically think and in a way design our own projects but I know personally I struggled not knowing exactly was wanted of us for projects. Professor Gray is hilarious and his powerpoint slide presentations always make me smile. I'm so glad I had him as my ENGE 1215 instructor! He's amazing and made getting up at 8:00am worth it.
Wicked mustache.
Instructor was very helpful during office hours and provided useful feedback when I had questions.
Applying it to the real world was the best part. Favorite teacher of the semester.
Great job teaching the course and motivating students.
The class was really fun.
I like all the jokes inserted into lecture to make the topic more interesting and keep attention focused on the content being presented.
Great Professor
Dr. Gray is my favorite teacher this semester.
A few instructions and examples could have been clearer on assignments such as &#34;How to be Hokie Engineer&#34;
Dr. Gray is one of my favorite professors because he makes class enjoyable and interesting. I would really like to have his as a professor again.
he is a great teacher
Mr. Gray is a very good teacher and he makes the class fun. I hope to get him for engineering next semester.
I really wish we had a greater ability to choose our own groups. I ended up being in one for Module 1 and Module 3 that didn’t really do much work and I had to do a lot.
BEST TEACHER EVER!!!!!!
Make directions clearer on assignments was difficult to understand sometimes
My best teacher. Great guy and cares about his students
The best teacher I've ever had!
Great teacher would recommend to other students
All good.
Hope you get a raise/tenure/promotion.
Feels unnecessary for CS

Dr. Gray is a good prof.
He was extremely understanding and did a great job connecting with his students.
He was a down-to-earth teacher that didn't sacrifice any professionalism in the process.
 This  course  was  very  similar  to  one  I  took  senior  year  the  only  difference  was  that  it  didn't  have  MATLAB  so  the  credits  didn't  transfer.  For  his  first  year  teaching  Dr.  Gray  exceeded  my expectations as a student.
Great instructor
He is the best! From what I've heard about my friends engineering courses he seems to be the coolest and most down-to-earth instructor for 1215 so I was lucky that I got him.
It was nice to have a teacher that had real world experience
N/A
Very good instructor
Really enjoyed the class and cannot wait until next semester
By far my favorite professor. Very upset that I didn't get him for ENGE 1216 next semester.
I thought the coursework was good but wondered how somethings would apply to engineering later in life.
Great sense of humor and knows what he's talking about
Great teacher.
n/a
I am really distraught at the fact that I was not be able to get him as my instructor for next semesters class.
Love the sense of humor it really helped me keep my focus and stay engaged.
I enjoyed Dr. Gray's class style. He mixed up lectures with activates well and made connections to the real world with an &#34;engineeringness&#34; discussion at the end of every class. He also brought a comedy aspect to the course with so many different activates using toast.
Keep this way
I dont think its his fault but what is required in assessments is vague sometimes
I believe he is a great instructor and I would take him again.
The course is useless and can be taught in week going over MATLAB. The rest of the material is absolutely unnecessary and to top it off the course professor didn't make it interesting at all although it isn't his fault that this course is extremely dull.
N/A
Better practice for matlab.
I liked how he incorporated everyday things into class about engineering (like toast).
good patient professor!
David Gray was an awesome professor who made engineering class fun
Needs more T??_??o???????a¸??_s?t¸?????
Dr. Gray is an excellent professor who respects students and prepares well for every his class.
Good sense of humor
I enjoyed his class and his teacher very much. He is a good teacher.
Dr. Gray did a great job of keeping long-term goals in mind while teaching so that he was able to focus on making understood topics important to the big picture and not be nitpicky. Dr. Gray also liked to show us things that were currently happening in the field of engineering at the end of his classes and it helped to remind us why we chose to pursue engineering and give us motivation to get through the hard and grueling aspects of pursuing an engineering degree.
Dr. Gray is a very chill and interesting teacher. He tries to get everyone's attention in a productive way and is not strict at all. He encourages creative thinking by having discussions with the class that may seem bizarre to other people. At the end of class he talks about specific engineering problems either he himself or the world is having and talks about the process that he or other people are going through to solve the problem in an engineering fashion.
David Gray is not like any teacher I've had before. Although I do not think he necessarily knows his students by name he was able to foster a sense of connection with every student in my class in a way that I have never seen before. You can really tell that he respects us greatly and wants each and every one of us to succeed. I appreciate that in a teacher very much.
He is a great teacher!
You are an outstanding teacher who keeps every class interesting even if the material is not always interesting.
Really enjoyed the professor I think he teaches this class the best way it can be taught
I hope the professor could upload the outline and related materials on time.
He was absolutely fantastic. I've heard this class is not everyone's favorite but he kept the class fun and interesting.
Cool dude
Please do not make anyone do the problem ID journals anymore or if you must make them fewer (either less problems per day or fewer days that we have to do them). They were very annoying to do every day and quickly became pretty useless because there were only so many good problems so it just devolved into trying to make up problems. I didn't have too much trouble with MATLAB but I think that it would be easier to understand if MATLAB skills were gone over more in class and also going over all of the challenges in class after they were due would be good because we went over one but didn't go over the others.
The Reverend is hands down the best teacher I've ever had.
I really appreciate all the good advice given throughout the semester.
He is a very fun person to have as an instructor as he makes the class as engaging as possible for us and always comes in with a good attitude
He is a very nice and cool teacher who is also able to teach the material effectively.
Very good instructor!
This guy really made a boring class exciting and fun to be in. He could improve by teaching MATLAB instead of making us figure it out on our own. That may be something across all classes though and is not unique to his class. The Engineering Department should look into how effective their current curriculum for MATLAB is taught.
Gray is a good instructor. He teaches well and asks the students of what they need in order to learn better.
I liked how interesting Dr. Gray provided engineering material however I wish I learned more about the individual disciplines of engineering more. I also wish I was able to understand MATLAB better from the class.
I loved the instructor and the class.
The instructor started the class with how everyone was feeling which made us laugh and feel apart of the class. The class was pretty easy but more help and introduction to MATLAB would be great.
Instructor came prepared to teach every day.
Great teacher chose him for next semester too
I loved Dr.Gray's class so much I am taking 1216 with him next semester! I had a great group and I really loved the support and motivation I got every day in class. Matlab was painful but I can't say I would be any better at it if I had any other professor. The humor supported a comfortable and productive atmosphere thank you for a great first experience in this program!
N/A
Good Job teaching the class
Was an awesome teacher to have for my first semester of school.
I understand you dont have much control over how you teach but you did good with it
Provide descriptions that clearly state the task and do not seem open to interpretation.
I really enjoyed Dr. Gray I wish I had him next semester.
No comment.
Dr Gray is one of my favorite professors here and I thoroughly enjoyed taking his class.
Dr. Gray made the class interesting and fun and it made me confident I want to be an engineer.
Something about the course that I would like to add would be learning more about the different engineering disciplines. We covered very few of them in this course.
You're amazing and one of the reasons I am enjoying my first semester so much. I am really looking forward to taking 1216 with you next semester
 The  instructor  is  way  too  underappreciated  by  the  school  of  engineering  maybe  even  the  whole  university.  Professor  really  cares  about  our  learning  and  strives  to  preserve  a  great  class environment.
This class taught me a lot about what engineering is. However I wish I could have been given more resources to learn about each engineering degree in depth.
The course needs more focus on branches of engineering
I would appreciate if we did less work.
Really cool professor who is extremely knowledgeable. He also extends beyond normal classroom learning to teach about real-world issues.
He was an excellent instructor and has been my favorite professor at Tech so far.
Thank you Dr. Gray. Perfect professor for my first engineering course here at VT can't wait to have you again next semester.
I found the course very useful and appreciate the hard work the Dr. Gray put in.
He makes the class fun even though the content is boring
Wales the Country Facts
Good enough
nope
I hope he can teach more MATLAB knowledge in the class itead of letting students study by themselves.
Thank you for being such an amazing and fun instructor!!!
He was a good instructor.
Very good professor
The class is run well I enjoyed all off the topics that were covered.
He did everything that he could in the course.
In spite of the mundane nature of most of this class he made it as engaging as possible with humor and practical applications.
super practical
He could have taught MATLAB coding in a better way. By doing more in-class examples teaching the syntax better making the students understand better.
Dr. Gray's teaching style and passion for teaching make engineering one of my favorite classes. He does an incredible job of making the classroom engaging and makes class a effective and rewarding experience.
His hair caught me off guard and distracted me a bit but I got use to it. Now I cannot picture him any other way please don't change because I would just have to readjust again.
very good dude
He really helped me decide what major I want to choose.
 Great  aproach  towards  the  class  and  made  the  content  engaging.  Would  appreciate  more  discussion  on  how  to  successfully  apply  for  engineering  internships  and  balanceing  work  load  with applications.
Great instructor.
He used his sense of humor well to relate to the class.
He's great
One of my favorite teachers I've had
Good course but MATLAB went from 0-100 pretty quickly
I really enjoyed the course and the instructor. My knowledge of whales has increased.
Thanks for a great semester!
Wish the course discussed the various engineering majors more. Did not really learn much about the other majors throughout the course.
Definitely my favorite professor this semester was very well prepared for class everyday. Nothing negative to say about this professor
Dr. Gray is in all honesty the best out of all of the teachers/professors I have had up to this point.
Dr.Gray is very passionate about teaching this class as well as he can and enhancing our first year engineering experience. However the course is straight trash so he doesn't have much to work with. There isn't much room for him to decide his own coursework it seems.
Great teacher. Very engaging. Added elements of fun into the boring coursework.
I loved the environment and I'm glad to have you for next semester!
Has an amazing dry wit; always has something clever to say regarding the topics he covered. Covered many examples of life skills which were highly interesting and educational.
He is one of the funniest teachers I've ever had.
great professor
Some of the course information was irrelevant but the instructor still made it interesting.
10 whales on a scale of 1-10 whales
He is the coolest teacher I have ever seen. What he taught is very attractive and interesting for me.
Thanks for a great semester.
He was a very sarcastic yet very funny professor. His humor into his work made the class very enjoyable.
He does a good job keeping everybody interested in what he is saying and keeping the lecture engaging and interesting.
Radical mustache!
very nice funny understanding guy the content was a lot of busy work and not very enjoyable especially the amount of reports not a ton of hands-on learning
love the whale facts
MATLAB is kinda trash
Amazing.
he was great I wish I get him next semester.
The content of this course is boring for the most part.
nice beard
Thank you for being such a great teacher! Looking forward to next semester!
He is a good professor
Class didn't teach much other than the engineering pathways
Excellent instructor - requested him for the next engineering class as well.
The TA was worse for the learning environment than actually helping she provided no useful help
I really enjoyed this class
Nice work this semester!
So good I signed up for his class next semester
You are such a great teacher I really had fun this semester. This class blows but you made it amazing.
He's very understanding and helpful when it comes to asking questions about final reports presentations MATLAB and other assignments.
Couldn’t have asked for a better professor. I honestly wish I got to know him better personally. Course was very fun engaging and I learned a lot.
Really great teacher. When I did my course request for next semester I put his class in my number 1 spot so that I had the best chance to get him next year.
I love this course
this course is a waste of time
None
Not really. Dr. Gray's class is very interesting and I'm so glad I got him as an instructor for my first semester at Tech. His class is always a bright spot in my week and has made me more interested in becoming an Engineer.
I loved the teaching style and sense of humor. Also Dr. Gray's understanding and sympathy for our mental health really helped me out.
good instructor pay him more
Overall fantastic teacher
You're awesome keep it up.
Dr. Gray is one of the best professors and educators I have had in my academic career.
I am excited to take ENGE-1216 with you
He is a very understanding teacher and wants the best for his students. He wants us to remain interested in engineering and does a good job at not making the material intimidating or scary.
He is an amazing proactive professor and he is super funny.
Great guy
Great mix of humor and seriousness it keeps students involved while keeping their attention. Makes learning fun.
Dr. Gray is the best instructor I have this semester. He has been supportive helpful and sparked my curiosity about engineering more and more every class. Thank you for a great semester Dr. Gray!
I enjoyed this course and learned a lot. Thank you for actually teaching.

Very great teacher.
This was by far my favorite class this semester due to having such a wonderful professor.
Engineeringness was always fun and interesting.
He was a great professor. I thoroughly enjoyed being in his class. I hope to have him as my instructor for next semester.
Awesome
Dr. Gray is an amazing teacher and I really enjoyed how he taught the class. He made it fun and interesting while effectively teaching the material.
Very engaging teacher.
Though challenging at times I see how this course is able to aid students on their path to engineering.
I really liked this professor
I think you are a great person but I hated this class. I understand the purpose for the class but it felt like a waste of time.
Was a great professor with an amazing attitude and was very consider to us freshman.
Really loved having him as a professor; will be taking ENGE1216 with him next semester to finish out my engineering course.
Can't wait to see ya next semester.
One of the best teachers I've ever had. I look forward to his class every week.
Moon facts were top tier.

Honestly just great
Amazing teacher I wish I could have him again.
I like his unusual examples to teach core principles.
Great professor
Dr. Gray was very easy to work with he was always fast to respond to any questions and concerns and I felt comfortable in his class.
Great professor and I really enjoyed his class
Best teacher I had all year and one of the best teachers that I have had.
The teacher was excellent in making the course content both engaging and interesting.
He was a really good instructor and I actually feel like I learned a lot he does assign a lot of work but nothing too unmanageable.
Fun course instructor was very enjoyable.
Starting every class with comments from students after the previous class was brilliant and made every class start out fun.

Dr. Reverend Gray is one of your best professors I'm only a freshman but I feel like this is going to hold true for my future years at VT take care of him
I really like how you group us up it taught me a lot of things
Stephen grades hard :(
Best teacher I had this year.

The instructor has really helped me stay on top of my work and even helped us create our first weekly schedules which are very helpful.
Dr. Gray is the best professor I have had this semester! He definitely wants to engage with his students even though the class is virtual. The course was very enjoyable.
I liked the class.
Thank you for teaching this course in a perfect &amp; engaging way especially during these difficult times.
Favorite teacher this semester and I hope to get him next semester.
Really cares about this subject. He made this course enjoyable and understandable as to why it is useful to our careers.
Very good professor I think my favorite of the semester. Made class entertaining with jokes and interaction with the class.
He was a very respectful teacher that connected well with the class.
great job
My team was good and did their work however my friend said their group had several members who did not contribute much and consistently evaluated their group members poorly during the peer evaluation  but  no  changes  were  made  to  the  group  by  you.  The  TA'S  graded  pretty  harshly  and  for  most  assignments  the  ACTUAL  rubric  was  not  posted  only  a  vague  one.  Then  when  our assignments get graded there is a specific rubric attached. Having the actual rubric would help. Overall the course was interesting and enjoyable and I am glad you were my instructor for ENGE 1215.
I think the teachers should coordinate better with the other engineering teachers because some of my friends were either really behind me or did things in reverse.
Definitely my favorite instructor.
Thank you making this course genuinely enjoyable and educationally stimulating at the same time. I don't think I could have recommended more of the engineers that I know to take your course next semester because I loved going to class everyday and listening to moon facts and then jumping into really cool engineering stuff. Overall I found everything about this class to be great my only problem was probably the big data project so if you have to change anything that would be it because I know you didn't want the Cs majors to do all of the coding for their group but I know for my group the two CS majors and one other did all of the coding and math while everyone worked on the report. I think I looked at the report on the last day for the first time probably three hours before it was due and was too tired to really change anything. Overall though nothing else should be changed with this course because it is amazing!!! And keep Karen and Stephen for as long as possible they are amazing TAs!
I would recommend Dr. Gray to my friends and I appreciated the respect he had for his students.
Great Prof wouldnt have wanted anyone else for the transition from high school to college.
Dr. Gray was the best professor I had this semester and did an amazing job with the online learning and making class exciting and fun.
mustache undefeated
Overall I thought Dr.Gray was a great instructor for the course.
This has been my favorite class I have taken in my college and high school experience. I absolutely love the professor and the course. Professor Gray made the material fun interesting and enjoyable. I looked forward to class every single Tuesday and Thursday.
Dr. Gray is a great professor.
Dr. Gray was clear about subject material kind and helpful. The TA's Karen and Stephen were also great.
Dr. Gray showed that he genuinely wanted us to succeed in the future and expressed that he wants to try his best to help us out.
Dr. Gray is by far my favorite teacher this semester. He is very funny gives really good advice and is a great teacher. Very nice stache.
I have made certain that I will be in Dr. Gray's ENGE 1216 class next semester.
Great professor who kept class interesting while still teaching effectively
It was a great course overall no big complaints.
Coolest guy here. Very fun interesting and educational classes!
Dr. Gray's class was always a good balance between having fun and learning important concepts. I genuinely looked forward to his class every week.
He is engaging and respectable.
Enjoyed your class Dr. Gray. Looking forward to 1216
Great instructor really enjoyed his class.
Awesome man.
This class is fun.
great attitude
Amazing class and the best online class I've ever been in. The way you run your class should be a model that other professors should follow
He so nice
I enjoyed how flexible you were able to make the assignments. It made any workload much easier to handle in all classes
Great teacher. I learned a lot more from him than half the things I learned in high school. I cannot wait to have him again next semester.
Excellent facial hair.
The best professor I've ever had.
Dr. Gray is a professor I would absolutely recommend to anyone who is taking engineering at VT.
Next semester we need something like moon facts to look forward to every class. Or a class on moon facts.
I think it will be hard to truly evaluate this class because we had to do it online.
The course seems to go by a little fast. Something that could help with that is making it so you go throught the basics before a lesson is assigned.
Great professor that knows how to connect with their students.
Probably my favorite teacher everything was made more interesting and fun which helps students learn more.
im taking his class again its super fun and makes me not hate engineering
I really enjoyed this class. It gave me a better grasp of engineering. I learned a lot about the field and how engineering is used in the real world.
Great instructor.
You're doing great. Your class is one of the only reasons i enjoy Tech.
Great Instructor
Such a great person and teacher as a whole. Thanks for a great semester!!
He was a very fun and engaging professor. He is able to capture the attention of his students through the humor and lightheartedness and then teach while using that attention.
Dr. Gray was an amazing professor! I was worried about the course when it first started as I really had no idea what engineering was or what was expected of me. Dr. Gray made sure that all of understood what we were doing and was able to set up extra help sessions either by himself or with his GTA's. This enabled us to to get the help we needed regardless of what or when we needed help.
He is awesome and a great man.
That planning to be a hookie engineer paper was deadly too me.
He is a great guy who I wish I had next year but my schedule wouldn't allow it unfortunately. I would take this class again.
Dr. Gray is a great professor and has made my first semester a great experience.
nothing
Excellent teacher. I loved the atmosphere of the class and Dr. Gray is an extremely good teacher to have for your first semester of college.
He was the best instructor I had this semester
The wax on wax off talk at the very beginning made a lot easier to get through some assignments. The &#34;life&#34; classes were really really useful.
I always felt like Dr. Gray knew what he was talking about. The course was valuable to me and I enjoyed it because of Dr. Gray.
