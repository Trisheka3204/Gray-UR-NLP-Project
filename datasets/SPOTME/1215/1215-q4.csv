7 - 7A - Please add any comments about the physical environment here
good but hot which let students sleepy
The classroom was hard to see sometimes because some of the seats are positioned that your back is to the board. However the presentations were easy to see and understand.
N/A
Boring he mostly just read of power points
Not crowded at all tables provided ample space to work.
Everything in the physical environmnt worked well.
Everyone got along and professor was respectful.
The physical environment is not bad.
The classroom was fine. I liked how there were projectors on both sides of the classrooms so there was never a problem seeing.
N/A
None.
It was good. People participated and were engaged.
I liked the size of the class.
The instructor and students were welcoming and respectful.
The classroom is old smelly and very hot which affects my ability to concentrate.
The classroom is a very relaxed environment that has opened up many discussions on various subject matter we have learned
Great environment.
it was great
All good.
I wish the building were a bit more modern.
Nice chairs
none
Sometimes a truck backing up outside would drown out the teacher's voice.
A simple class room. Chairs and tables in good condition.
Chair's were a little uncomfortable.
Felt very comfortable in the class.
Sometimes the class gets excessively hot.
Very helpful and we could voice our opinions/ideas and not be judged.
Everything seemed well planned out and properly demonstrated.
some of the chairs were stationary and some were rolly chairs please make them all one or the other
Good environment.
n/a
Everyone respected each other.
It was average. Never at an uncomfortable temperature and little to no background noise
The rolling tables were endlessly annoying
I had no issues with the physical environment.
kinda hot
The rooms temperature was always hot it smelled bad in there and the a/c was so loud that the back tables could not here Dr. Gray.
Randolph hall is terrible our room had noise problems with inconsistent heat/ac that made it difficult to hear.
Randolph 316 was never comfortable (temperature wise) it was typically very hot and many classes I began to sweat just sitting still. The room is very large and sound does not carry very well. For the  majority  of  the  class  my  group  sat  in  the  back  corner  and  it  was  hard  to  hear  other  people  asking  and  answering  questions  across  the  room.  The  room  can  be  improved  by  installing  a FUNCTIONAL A/C unit and a teacher microphone system like the ones used in Davidson 281 lectures.
Very hot and crowded classroom.
Classroom was very outdated. AC unit was so loud that you could not hear the professor from the back of the room. Very hot and stuffy. Chairs are hard to move.
It always smells and is vert hot in here
is was hot in the summer
It was way too hot in the classroom
its good
Very hot at the beginning of the semester.
It is good. The air condition works well.
The AC was inconsistent throughout the year.
Was always very hot smelled weird and the air conditioning/ heat units were very hot.
AC in one corner is loud but he was always conscientious about it
Sometimes the fans were loud and it was hard to hear the instructor.
The third floor of Randolph is very warm and stuffy which encourages sleep in a 3:30 class which is the optimal environment to go to sleep during class. Finding a cooler dryer more ventilated room would prove to be a more effective learning space.
Sometimes the seats are too close together.
Really enjoyed the classroom for this course.
The last row is too far from the screen sometimes I cannot see the words on the screen if I do not photo the slides.
I really liked the chairs and the fact there were outlets for everyone.
even in the back of the class i could still see well enough
Goodwin is super nice
The environment is very nice with the 2 big windows and since it is a regular sized class it is easy to focus on Professor Gray.
No additional comments.
He creates a positive light-hearted environment in which a student can feel good but also get work done.
The physical environment was fine it was just a long walk to Goodwin.
The environment was big but the projectors were a little finicky.
Good environment well spaced out.
Adequate space to learn.
the classroom is really nice
Again super comfortable environment. I felt like I could share my ideas and I loved the laid back feel.
N/A
good environment
Enjoyed the swivel chairs which made it easy to move in group work.
kinda crammed
Fun entertaining and full of toast.
It was good.
Dr. Gray helped make the environment of the class fun and exciting even when we weren't doing exciting stuff in class.
Class was big enough to have a variety and diversity in group work and group projects.
There wasn't a lot of space around the seats to work on presentations projects and other group work.
Its a really nice space just really far from campus.
I would appreciate some more instruction with MATLAB as it was difficult for me to follow most of the time. Especially on the take-home exam.
Good
Class had a good environment that fostered learning
The environment was good
nope

The environment was great. I was put on a friendly design team and all of the other students were always there for me support when I raised concerns about any issues I may have faced.
It was a fun place to be.
n/a
The desks are in very tight rows which makes getting around the classroom a little difficult
I liked my group that I was put in. The overall atmosphere was really relax and calm. I wasn't stressed by just sitting in class.
better size class
It was comfortable enviroment to work in but it is so large that at time contributing to class discusions becomes more difficult
N/A
It was a very big room and I was lucky enough to sit up front.
good environment
The physical environment is nice. The classroom is one of the better ones.
I sat second row and could hear and see everything clearly.
The classroom layout made it easy to communicate with my team about relative assignments in the class.
Goodwin is one of my favorite buildings on campus. Good room setups and lots of light.
Welcoming open fun at times. Interactive.
Goodwin is a great hall
I had no issues with the environment we were in.

Physical environment was fine.
It's very calm and relaxing to take this class in Goodwin Hall.
Overall fine. Sometimes some people would be constantly talking in the back but in general was not that annoying.
I really have no problems with this.
