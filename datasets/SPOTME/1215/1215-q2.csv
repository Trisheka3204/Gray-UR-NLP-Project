not sure
Wales the country
asking
listening carefully in the class and finish my homework well
I disagree with a majority of the course design (departmental level above the instructors control). Students worked on 'filler' projects and never learned applicable content. Something like designing a high power/low power circuit would be more useful than writing a paper on how to improve a problem. The programming project was useful; however module 1 &amp; 3 were not useful. The teamwork can be applied to better and more useful projects.
To be a better learner I could have been more active in opportunities to help me tune the technical skills learned through this course. I did not attend any MATLAB workshops offered.
I could've gotten the work done faster.
I wasn't always fully engaged which could have been because the course and assignments at many points felt trivial.
Pose more questions to the instructor.
I could have been more intentional about out of class work
I could have learned coding before hand.
Perhaps put more effort into the MATLAB assignments as i would usually do them quickly and would not refine the code
Start assignments beforehand
I could have planned my work out better.
MatLab was a little rough but I persevered and figured it out enough to do the required assignments. I think giving us something similar to the challenges in class and just have us work on it while Dr. Gray and a TA walked around to answer questions would be beneficial.
Study more.
thought i was pretty good
I could have paid more attention to the presentations in class.
take notes on matlab tools.
Be more attentive during class.
Planned out times to meet with team members better
Worked better with my team and done my assignment on time.
Listened more

Tried harder
Payed more attention in class
Go to instructor office hours.
I could have gone out of my way to learn MATLAB.
Had better time management.
I feel if I participated more in class I could have maybe obtained more from this class.
I could have put a bit more effort into the MATLAB assignments. I did not particularly like coding during that part of the semester and decided to allocate time that should have been put towards the MATLAB assignments to other less important areas.
I could have done more research on the research assignments rather than the bare minimum.
Pay attention better.
I really don't know. I put in the minimum effort to get the grade but I don't know what I could have done to improve myself.
I believe my performance was quite on par with the standards of the course but in most assignments provided by Rev. Gray there were sections covering what one could do to go above and beyond in learning the material covered by the assignments. If I continually did these I would have been a better learner.
Pay more attention in class.
i don't know
Put more time into Matlab.
I could have maybe gone above and beyond for more of the assignments.
Do assignments in advance.
I could have spent more time on this class and have done more research for the subject matter.
I could have spent more time outside of class working on my own side projects to deepen my understanding of topics such as MATLAB and I could have researched the different engineering fields on my own outside of class more.
Gave my self more time to complete assignments so I wouldn't have to rush at all.

I turned in a few of the earlier assignments late. I also did like 80% of my assignments the day they were due.
Tried to submit assignments on time especially part 4 on MATLAB.
listen to instructors and ask for help if needed
not sure didnt really learn much because of the course material
I probably could have taken a few things in this class more seriously. When I had to choose between work in this class or any other class I'd usually choose the other class because ENGE 1215 is more interesting and easier to work on which sometimes gave me lower grades than I could have gotten.
Nothing I loved every second of this class and I did my best.
n/a
Communicate misunderstandings
Nothing I just followed class instructions and went well.
I could have more throughly read the feedback I receive from the TA's.

I could have participated more in class.
I cant think of anything maybe done work a head of time

Complete my assignments ahead of time
I could have worked better with my group to make sure we did not leave things to the last minute
I could have gone to office hours
I did not take advantage of many office hours. Although I felt comfortable with the material I could have easily sat in on an office hour and hear from other students
Not procrastinate on big projects
I could have spaced out more time for assignments.
I could have gone to more office hours and particpated more in class
I general I'd just say payed more attention during zoom classes and eliminated distractions.

Better research for papers
Take more time on assignments instead of rushing to get them done
I could have been more proactive when doing my work and procrastinate much less

notes in class
concentrate more on learning
Taken more time to review my assignments before submitting them
I could have managed my time a bit better in order to turn in assignments on time and earn full points.

I could have payed attention more in class.
I could have done more of the above and beyond portions of assignments.
