All semester he had this toast analogy that led to participation in activities critical thinking and lots of laughing. But in the end he would relate it all back to engineering and how various engineering disciplines are needed to actually produce toast and how when coding you can't assume anything and you have to tell MATLAB exactly what you want it to do. All his analogies would always tie in really well and this definitely helped me to better understand the concept of engineering!

Team assignments
Kept the class interesting.
Presented material in an interesting way. I was never bored in the class and was always looking forward to it.
He created a great atmosphere which was essential to a good learning environment
Very calm and very open with his students. It really felt like he respected us and was open about the fact that some assignments would not make sense at first but would help with skills needed later down the line.
