Great teacher engages students well and explains concepts in a interesting way.
Thank you for your efforts in accommodating our assumptions on grading Doc. Gray.
I think you did an excellent job of running a relatively poorly laid out course. You kept me interested in the subject matter and caused us to care enough to put lots of time and effort into our drone.
Less matlab and more solidworks. I liked the take home lego project. Matlab was just tedious and repetitive. Also I feel like CAD was really intimidating at first but now I think its easy.
Dr. Gray tried to make class enjoyable and fun and I think the class appreciated that but ENGE 1215/1216 just felt like a waste of time. The two courses felt like busy work and projects that felt put together at the last second.
Thank you so much for a great semester. Sorry for falling asleep on ya but it wasn't you. It was just because I could never get enough sleep.
No hes a great engineering professor!
HEs the man. Would love to have him again in any other class. Makes engineering really fun
Could have provided more assistance for MATLAB
He is an excellent professor and would love to see him in and around the campus.
best. instructor. EVER!!!
N/A
He really cared about our class and worked on improving himself as a professor to further help the class.
Clearly has some good ideas for the future makes the class fun very easy to talk to
Dr. Gray was definitely more interesting that other teachers. His hippopotamus theme kept the class engaged and excited for each next class.
You are a really funny and well spoken person. I think you've learned a lot from this semester about how students want to be graded. Make sure that your grading style is fair and open like it was in the second half of the semester.
Instructor was very good and made the class enjoyable.
You are an allstar
Great professor and great at expecting the most out of his students and out of himself.
- less lecture - smaller group - more exquipments - clearer instruction + Gray is awesome
Very easy to approach/friendly never felt like I was being talked down to just felt like he genuinely wanted to show the class things
He did a great job of adapting on the fly with our class and cared about being the best teacher he could be.
Very hard on himself regarding his job however I don't think he gives himself enough credit. Great teacher. Would recommend him to any future student who intends to take ENGE 1216.
Really good professor seems excited to be there and excited to make us like engineering
More solidworks and less matlab
nope
He's been my favorite teacher in college so far.
Thank you.
I love Gray so damn much and I wish he could teach every class here. He is an incredible professor and I cannot stress enough how much I want him to overturn the entire ENGE department and make it something great with his jokes and great powerpoints and engaging lectures.
He was certainly a great teacher.
Gray was a great instructor! He always made the class fun and I learned a lot from him. I feel like I liked the small class size like we did from 1215.
nothing
He made an 8am class a lot more bearable and even enjoyable at sometimes.
My favorite teacher that I've had at Tech so far.
8 ams hard to wake up for.
thank you dr. gray you did a good job
Dr. Gray was my favorite professor this semester. His class was a great time and I learned a lot!
I wish we hadn't spent so much time on Matlab it took away time from other important subjects.
He has been one of my favorite teachers at Tech. He really cares about the students and has a way of engaging the class using humor.
Would recommend for anyone else to have. Good teacher with a great personality. Always willing to take the time to further explain stuff outside of class.
I know that you said the original survey we all took kind of hurt but that it was necessary to grow. I wouldn't get too down on yourself about it. It was your second semester there's always a learning curve. I would 100% recommend taking your class to any future engineering students.
I love dr gray but Im not a fan of this course because of the semester long group project. I got stuck in a not very good group so their poor work has been affecting my grade even though I've been doing as best as I can while picking up 3 of my group members slack
Amazing teacher.
Dr. Gray was a good teacher for a mediocre course. 1216 didnt really foster any engineering skills that I didnt already have and I dont think it would help anyone else either.
He did not give rubrics for the first part of the semester which made the assignment requirements confusing.
Dr. Gray is one of my favorite instructors that I have had over the past two semesters and I believe that he will be an admired professor.
Dr. Gray is really cool. His students appreciate him as well as relate to him and with more experience and training I think he could be a great teacher. He is approachable and I don't feel stupid asking questions that I know are probably stupid questions. He constantly reassures us that we are all capable of doing this which is nice especially when these things are easy to forget.
He is a great instructor who takes what would be a totally boring class interesting.
He's a funny guy nice guy
Engineering 1216 is dumb and does not help my future as an engineer at all. Maybe we could actually learn about the engineering majors instead of random stuff. This is not David Gray's fault but due to the structure of the class.
Legendary. 11/10 IGN
Hippos
Pretty nice
nil
Mr Gray is a great instructor that does not deserve to be teaching this class. The curriculum is very broad and does not teach anyone anything. People wanting to go into anything but mechanical or aerospace are out of luck as the only two projects are based around those two majors. Those that do want to go into those fields are bored since the projects are such basic applications of their major that they are probably already doing more advanced things in their clubs or design teams. Additionally for those that do not know what they want to do yet the class does not explore all the majors VT has to offer leaving the student just as stranded and confused as before. This course does not prepare engineers for success but rather is a filler for a first year engineer.
good teacher
Really funny dude
Best engineering professor I've had yet.
Great teacher knows a lot about what he is teaching but is also humble.
I think Dr. Gray is a very good teacher. The one problem I have with the class is that it really fosters the mentality of either succeeding or failing as a group. While this can be a very good thing it can also be a little discouraging in relation to the turnout of GPA resulting from group work.
Has a great sense of humor. The board and hippobidness were highlights of my day.
I was a fairly average course made better by Dr. Gray.
Good job.
10/10 would recommend
David is awesome
I still don't understand how assignments are graded.
Great professor.
He was an amazing teacher and I actually looked forward to his class. He treats us as equals and is open to our ideas. He also incorporated real world issues into class time discussion. Overall great guy.
David Todd Gray is one of the best instructors i have ever hade
Definitely my favorite instructor this semester I really enjoyed his class
Dr. Gray is an amazing professor. He made every student feel welcomed. Even though the class was confusing at some points and sometimes he didn't even know what was going he made sure get back on track and make sure everything was okay.
Hes great. I want him to be the reverend at my wedding
You're doing a great job for your first year teaching! I really enjoyed this class.
He made the class engaging and interesting even if the material wasn't that enjoyable.
He made the drone project feel way more approachable and broke it down well for the class.
The instructor was doing to best he could regarding the poorly structured overlying course of ENGE 1216. Adjusting the course structure would definitely remove restrictions on the professor.
He is the man! He is a great teacher for 1216 and knows how to make the class fun and interesting. Hippobidness and Engineeringness for the win! The man needs (deserves) a raise. At first his above and beyond thing scared me but it turned out to motivate me and gave me something to work for and look forward it. It allowed/made me have fun with the assignments. Keep up the good work Dr. Gray.
David Gray is terrific. Foundations is awful in its current state and needs a complete overhaul.
Really enjoyed hippobiddness and engineeringness
He is a good guy.
Great teacher would have him again if I had more foundations of engineering classes. I recommended him to a friend that is coming to VT engineering next fall.
He's a funny teacher that makes class more interesting.
This was his second semester teaching enge 1216 so I can understand why there some mistakes with his assignments and teaching methods.
David is great at engaging with the students and joking around with students.
Thank you for wanting to improve and being open to feedback. Dr. Gray has a lot of potential to really make the course great but the department guidelines are really holding him back.
He was super cool and refreshing
I think many people struggled to affectively use solidworks so it made modeling our plane very difficult.
Great professor really glad I was able to be in his class.
Awesome job at making the class very engaging. While I wish I would have known about the expectations about going above and beyond earlier on I really enjoyed the class.
I have enjoyed your class a lot. Whenever I had a question it was addressed professionally and Dr. Gray tried his best to always answer honestly and quickly.
I really appreciate how responsive you are to class feedback. The only complaints I have about this class are either the department's fault or issues that you addressed and fixed after the midterm evaluation. Good job bossman. I wouldn't change much of anything you did.
Mustache
He is the best professor I have had in my two semesters of college. He is so entertaining that the most boring topics became interesting. I wish I could take 1215 again just so I can have him as my professor. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
Dr. Gray was my most enjoyable instructor this semester and I believe that his attitude about engineering made me appreciate the subject more.
ENGE1216 needs to be completely rewritten. All the professors think the projects are awful and teach us nothing and the vast majority of students would agree.
Dr. Gray is the man. He may get a lot of flak but that is because HE ASKS FOR IT. He truly wants to better himself as an instructor and wants his students to succeed to the best of their ability if he can help it. It takes a lot of personal determination to take criticism and the ACTUALLY make a change based on the self-inflicted criticism. Dr. Gray is an embodiment of Ut Prosim and I do not feel he gets enough credit. I respect the crap out of him for this. It is foolish for anyone not to realize the inherent intrinsic value Dr. Gray brings to VT as a whole.
Class was too long and drawn out for no reason. Our in class assignments were not useful or relatable to the class Engineeringness was a waste of time and I never learned a single thing from it and we would start the actual material for the class fifteen minutes into class after spending that entire time talking about Hippos. His teaching of MATLAB and Solidworks was close to nothing and his rubrics and grading system was incredibly unfair until we all started getting very mad at him. Also the entire semester he was pressuring us to get the drones done as soon as possible but would never provide us the material and information to do that until last minute and then proceed to get mad about how we did not do it earlier.
Really great teacher! Once he teaches the the course for a few semesters and fully understands it his class will be one of the best the engineering department has to offer. He relates to the students and is blatant and honest when issues arise or when an assignment he is giving is unfair or doesn't make sense. This makes students feel respected by the teacher which makes us much more willing to listen to him. He engages the class with fun witty slides about hippos and student responses about classwork. He is one of the only teachers I have who makes a genuine attempt to gauge how the students feel about the class and assignments and what we think he should do to improve the class. It is obvious he cares about doing a good job as our instructor and enjoys teaching. Some of his best lessons were unrelated but very interesting engineering topics that would probably never be taught in a non-specialized course.

Great teacher highly recommend.

You did a really great job at keeping the course engaging and made it easier to focus on because of it.
Still needs some help in grading fairly and following rubrics
Grading was unclear
The little things like talking about hippos during the beginning of classes made me want to come everyday.
N/A
Fantastic instructor and mixed casual and relaxed demeanor with being task oriented.
I really like the fact that Dr.Gray had someone come in and take feedback from us on him.
I enjoyed this class more than most of my other friends Dr. Gray made this class enjoyable.
Dr. Gray is a fantastic teacher and will greatly impact his future students.
I wish all my teachers were more like Dr. Gray
Dr. Gray was a blast. He made the curriculum interesting and he was always enthusiastic about the class.
Sick mustache!
Grading was very tough. Even when done what was instructed I was constantly worried about my grade.
This course focused more on Matlab than was necessary. It would have been more beneficial to designate more time to Solidworks. The Solidworks section of this course felt a bit rushed.
Really excellent year. Thanks for everything
Sometimes the things he talked about did not really pertain to the class.
I feel like Dr. Gray genuinely cares about his job and his students. He wants to teach to best of his ability and actively seeks ways to improve in order to see his students succeed.
Sometimes I feel like the course is biased towards specific engineering majors which can make choosing a major at the end of the year difficult because we do not know much about the other majors.
Great guy better mustache
He is a nice guy just the course has a lot of loopholes and problems so most of us are always confused on what exactly to do most of the time.
He is a great teacher and has a great personality
He was really fun and an awesome instructor.
David Gray was one of my favorite professors this semester. He was interesting and gave a good introduction into Engineering concepts. I enjoyed having him as a teacher. Not related to the professor the course could definitely be improved. This course requires you to work with partners on a drone project. It sounds cool when you get a team of 6 people to work on the drone with. But it stops becoming cool when 4 of your partners stop showing up for almost the entire semester including only 4/6 showing up for class and 2/6 actually participating on the drone project. David Gray was a great professor and did everything he could to help. But I wish this course did not exist all together because trying to do Solid Works programming and building as a two man team is a lot. I was not impressed with most of my partners.
I think he was really good and have no problems
I don't have anything else to add because Dr Gray was an all around amazing teacher.
The class enjoyed his humor however some of the directions could have been clearer.
Cool mustache and effective instructor 1
Try not to make it too much like a lecture plz
This guy needs a raise VT is shafting him rn.
I assumed that I would hate 1216 as much as I hated 1215. I loved it and I think it is down to the instructor. He was open with grading and how grades and rubrics were created and what he was going to expect of us. Total god move: he showed us his own evaluation to see how he was doing in the eyes of the department. He talked about his old research which I was super interested in. And the mustache was excellent.
Great and humorous teacher. Very fun classes and always in a good mood.
He is cool
He is a very cool professor and I like him a lot. He made the classes
Overall for his first semester teaching 1216 I think Dr. Gray did a very good job. He was always very open to our class and made it clear that he too was learning his way around the course. His work ethic and the amount of effort he puts into job put him above any instructor/professor I've had thus far at Virginia Tech. On the other hand with regards to 1216 I think there is considerable room for improvement starting with organization. Everything about this class seemed out of order and counter intuitive. We never even built anything until the last 4 weeks of the semester because we spent  the  first  seven  weeks  working  through  MATLAB.  Also  I  think  students  who  know  what  major  they  want  to  go  into  should  be  able  to  pick  a  project  related  to  that  major  instead  of  picking professors and hoping that they're doing the project the student wants.
Really made the class fun and interesting
David is awesome. I would recommend him to anyone and everyone.
The Reverent Dr. Gray really couldn't have done a better job this year. The only thing that he needs to improve on is presenting the rubric and making sure each group understands what needs to get done. But near the end of the semster the Reverent Dr. Gray was pretty on top of it. He is easily one of the best instructors I've had at Virginia Tech.
Very funny and teaches really really well!
&lt;3
N/A
Great teacher- smart funny and easy to talk to.
Dr Gray is hilarious and an amazing instructor
Dr. Gray is my favorite Virginia Tech professor I've had
He is a good teacher and the class was hurt by the curriculum given to him to teach. This course needs to be changed to encompass engineering in a better way that is still fun and challenging.
Solid guy who understands what it's like to be a college student
It was a very fun semester with Rev. Dr. Gray as the instructor.
Stop teach Matlab its not a good coding language to be teaching for introductory programming. Its a matrix based programming language that isn't even object oriented. I guarantee if the non- programmers in this class tried their hand at java or python they would be extremely lost as Matlab has not proven much help.
What a guy
Dr. Gray is a very enjoyable teacher and made the material as fun and interesting as one could and he really did want the best for all of us.
Funny guy kept the class engaged.
He did a great job a keeping the class enjoyable while still teaching.
This instructor should be made a professor here at Virginia Tech. He embodies everything that makes a teacher great.
Dr. Gray is intelligent witty and a fantastic teacher. He exceeds expectations and encourages his students to do the same. It is evident that he cares personally about his students and his job and that this is more than a day at work for him. He practices what he preaches and leads by example. He is definitely one of my favorite teachers of all time.
Class was fun.
Dr. Gray is a down-to-earth and relatable person and he does his best to make sure that everyone actually enjoys being in class. Hearing him talk about his extensive real-world work experience was helpful because it gave more reason to care about the concepts we were learning.
He was very helpful during drone testing.
I hope I have professors who care as much about their students as Dr. Gray does in the rest of my college career.
Good
Loved him great instructor and helped us all enjoy engineering.
No additional comments.
I think Dr. Gray is an amazing instructor and really made the course engaging. He is very funny and smart. I also appreciate how he taught the class from a business perspective and kept it real with us for how life will be in industry. He was also incredibly transparent with us which I strongly appreciated. Like when he shared his performance review with us I really respected that because he is trying to help us and is doing it through sharing his own experiences.
Very good professor who makes students actually want to continue in engineering
I liked how we worked with drones this semester and I liked the group I was put in. I really liked how we started SolidWorks I like SolidWorks much better than Matlab.
Great instructor made this class as good as it can be for the most part
The instructors were very good and did what I expected them to do. The course however was very lame. I didn’t understand what half the things we learned in class had to do with the assignments out of class. The curriculum was not very helpful Matlab is useless and dumb. We should’ve worked on building the drone for longer and more solidworks.
He was honestly great
I really enjoyed your class and your teaching methods for the past two semesters. I really hope that we can work together on something in the future. I really like that you are always looking to improve and I want to achieve the same methods.
None
He is one of the greatest instructors I've ever had.
Good prof.
Dr. Gray is an amazing and engaging professor very glad I got him
One of the best instructors I have had the privilege to be taught by.
need a different grading system.
good
In all honesty Dr. Gray's potential is severely limited by the way ENGE 1216 is setup. The design project should be left up to the instructor to suit there area of expertise increasing the potential for our project. Dr. Gray has immense knowledge on all the small but crucial aspects of being an engineer that can't be taught by a textbook. He was the first professor I've had who I thought truly cared about my success outside of Virginia Tech and geared the class in an appropriate manner.
He is a cool nice teacher
He did a good job explaining what was going on in class and clarified any confusing instructions.
At the beginning of the semester the requirements for the drone project were a little unclear. While it all worked out in the end try to give students a clearer picture so they can plan ahead easier.
Instructor was well prepared and clarified the doubts effectively.
The course is useless but the instructor is great
Great professor who is way too hard on himself becuase of student feedback. Most of the students in the class would complain because some of the work he gave us was challenging or they didn't like it even though Dr. Gray would offer ample assistance to these students. These lazy students would then go on to leave rude comments in the post-class surveys which would make Dr. Gray feel bad. However he is a great professor and deserves to move up in the engineering department.
Dr. Gray truly makes the class fun and engaging and serves as a role model for the type of engineer that I'd like to be
Great teacher.
Course wasn't too exciting but Dr. Gray did a great job of keeping students interested and was also very easy to reach and willing to help whenever needed. He showed interest in every group and talked to the groups individually about what he thought about our drones and our powered flight testing which I thought was really cool since a lot of instructors don't show too much interest in the students' work.

It was a fun class
Absolute legend
David Gray is one of the best professors I've ever had
The coolest professor i've had as a college student by far
Rev. David Gray is a great teacher he needs a raise.
Best teacher I've ever had in all my years of teaching. Seriously he's amazing across the board I wish he could teach every class I take for undergrad.
Good energy throughout the class
Thank you Dr. Gray for everything over the last year. You made my freshman year much better.
He is very helpful and caring.
Dr. Gray was very engaging and was an excellent teacher
Very good teacher. Virginia Tech is extremely lucky to have him.
His mustache is lit.
One of my favorite professors I've had here.
I very much appreciate the amount of effort and care Dr Gray puts into the course he teaches. He knows that the course is not the most engaging or interesting (especially if you do not like planes) so he does his best to cater to everyone's interest. I am very sad that I have not been able to attend one of his classes since spring break I miss them. Hands down one of the best professors at Virginia Tech.
Mothbidness is amazing
Better than 1215 but still a bit pointless. Dr. Gray is great.
The course overall is really unnecessary and should be redone to better transition general engineering students into their choice major. Professor Gray was funny and comical making his classes enjoyable.
Enjoyed the class very much while it lasted wish I had him for first semester
Awesome professor. Willing to help you when needed. Nice mustache. Likes moths

I think it would be helpful for both the students and the graders if Dr. Gray made his templates more clear. I think there was often a disconnect between the descriptions given in brackets on the templates and the rubrics which led to a needless loss of points. Updating the templates or rubrics makes it easier for both the students and graders to understand. That makes it easier for both parties to successfully complete/grade each assignment.
Wonderful
He was a good instructor to listen to and had a great plan laid out for the semester however once we went online the work seemed to increase and though interest was shown in not overwhelming us we still had huge assignments due the days we had major tests to worry about as well. Also the grading was harsh and the point system did not really make sense.
I think it worked out well. During the online part in quarantine I think the talks going over aerodynamics could have been shorter. A big part of them was discussing the math which we ended up just  putting  in  matlab  and  we  didn't  necessarily  need  to  comprehend  the  equations  and  variables.  Also  it  was  annoying  that  the  templates  were  not  truly  reflective  of  an  assignments'  rubric.  I understand you only need to look at the rubric but it didn't make much sense why they differed.
He's awesome! He is always funny and kind.
I really appreciated how much Dr. Gray made an effort to see how his students were doing during this time. Not all teachers were as personal and as caring but his efforts to show his dedication to his students was recognized.
Thank you for making this class as least stressful as possible but still educational
Having Gray for both engineering courses made for a great freshman year at Virginia Tech. I tell anyone who is coming to Tech to try and get into his class because I know they'll love it too. Thank you Dr. Gray for an amazing year I hope you have an excellent summer!
Most caring professor I've had thus far in a STEM class at VT. You can tell he wants us students to succeed which is very important to me.
Really cool guy; good humor as well. He's willing to adjust due dates if many students are dealing with lots of work in other classes.
Good Guy
He knows how to teach and improves on things that might not work out the first time.
The enthusiasm and organization you had regarding this class made it much easier to learn and be engaged during your class. It really seemed like you care about your students and what they have to say and that was really refreshing.
Nothing as of right now a good teacher he is.
He is a fun and polite teacher that provided helpful feedback for our drone design.
The teacher was very approachable.
I liked the course a lot.
Dr. Gray had a very effective transition to an online environment. I had some very poor experiences with other instructors in an online environment but I think Dr.Gray was very effective in online class. He kept communication lines open and posted information in multiple places so that nothing fell through the cracks. I loved the personality of this class and it made me enjoy learning and engineering as a whole. Dr. Gray inspired me to pursue engineering further and grew my passion for engineering.
 The  board  was  a  great  part  of  your  class  and  you  should  continue  doing  that.  It  was  really  nice  to  see  that  you  read  everyone's  comments  and  its  cool  to  see  that  you  respond  sometimes personally. It shows that you actually care about your students and does a lot to generate respect.
Greatful to have you as a teacher
Thank you for the moths.
Dr. Gray is hands down the best professor I have had at Virginia Tech. It was a pleasure to have him for 1215 and 1216.
great professor
Great Teacher and wonderful guy!
Great instructor.
Very charismatic professor. Very enjoyable to be in his class
Best teacher ever no lie and best mustache
Your course is really good.
Dr. Gray brings a light hearted nature to the classroom. I was worried about changing my engineering teacher this semester but he provided a very welcoming atmosphere and it wasn't difficult to get used to the change of scenery. Although the subject matter hasn't been my favorite I would consider Dr. Gray to be one of the best if not the best professor I've had thus far at my time at Virginia Tech.
Very good professor interesting intelligent engaging
DAVID GRAY IS THE BEST
David Gray does a good job of keeping people engaged and responding to feedback that students give as well as being empathetic to each individual student and their different situations.
Class was very engaging and fun.
I really enjoyed having him as a professor and class was enjoyable.
None
Amazing instructor. He is the best I would recommend every GE student to take him. He explains the concepts really well.
The instructor did an amazing job at explaining complicated engineering math and science in a simple and comprehensible way. The class could use some more structure when it comes to hands on projects through.
His mustache is fire. His vests are fire. His mothbidness is fire. He developed some very memorable traditions throughout our class that were very enjoyable. He always related material to actual experiences we might have in the engineering world which was always very valuable insight.
I personally really enjoyed this course and thought that he handled the transition to online in a really good way.
Best professor that I've had at VT so far. Keep up the good work. I'm happy I got to have him for two semesters. #WhalesAndMoths4Lyfe
It was a pleasure learning in this class with Dr. Gray. When everything changed because of the pandemic he was the teacher I got an email from first which really helped and he was always there and cared for his students.
Without a doubt Dr. Gray is the best instructor I've had in either college or high school. Please promote this man because he most definitely deserves it (I would bet money that his other students' SPOT surveys concur with this statement).
I enjoyed having him as a professor. Something unique about the class was including moths in both the in-person and online lectures and I thought this was a nice comic relief and made the class fun.
He was an overall effective teacher and he also worked to create personal relationships with students during my time taking this course. He is a very funny dude but also extremely knowledgeable and willing to help whenever he can. He is extremely responsive to email and so was his TA.
favorite professor this semester
Absolutely adore Dr.Gray will miss his class and his dry humor. I would recommend him to anyone taking 1215 or 1216 next year because of the respect and care he puts into each student.
Dr Gray is a fantastic professor who is excellent at conveying the course material and makes the class fun and interesting to be a part of.
Great instructor highly recommend.
the instructor was very good
Easily one of the greatest professors I've had he actively seeks to better himself and the curriculum he teaches he asks students for feedback and advice from their perspective. Dr. Gray puts a massive amount of effort into shaping the foundations of engineering course and with his guidance I think ENGE 1215 and 1216 will see great growth.
i really appreciate how much care he puts into making sure we value our time in his class and making sure we are doing okay in other classes and in his class
Keep doing what you're doing I think it worked well
moths
The moth facts were a fun addition to the course material and I enjoyed the engineeringness lessons.
MOTHS
Incredibly nice and easy-going guy. Nice facial hair too.
My favorite professor by far this year; he also made a great transition to online and still managed to keep the material engaging.
Very personable and engaging. Added humor to the class to make this class less stressful.
Best professor I've had I wish I got to finish out the semester in person with this class.
Great professor
Dr. Gray has a healthy sense of humor which helped keep normalcy after the switch.
Dr. Gray really cares about all of his students and he wants us to not only work hard and challenge ourselves but also to enjoy what we are doing. This class made me feel like I mattered as an individual and that we are all in this together especially in these stressful times.
he was cool
Dr. Gray is chill and a good professor.
I really appreciate how Dr. Gray was able to keep this course intriguing.
Please allow for us to chose our groups next time. I seriously had the A team set up in my class but I couldn't get to be with my friends like I had planned. One of my group members from last semester was there so I really wanted to group with him but sadly we couldn't. Otherwise keep it up! I'm definitely going to miss ya next semester
He was an awesome person and an awesome teacher.
He was good other than the fact that he tried to do his stand up act every class
Thank you so much for caring and being such a great professor!
You are an amazing professor
N/A
Significantly outperformed the course that was given to him. Folks give him a better course.
I enjoyed Foundations of Engineering with Dr. Gray.
Great professor who really cares about his students
I know you read these so I just want to say that I'm really sad that we didn't get to have a full semester. Really. I was so excited to see where we were going after spring break and that was all taken away from us. I was sad about it for a while but then I decided to put my full effort into the assignments that we had left to show what my group could do even in the face of a global crisis. I'm really going to miss your class. I'm sad about a lot of things but not being able to complete my freshman year has stayed on my mind as much as not being able to see my family members has. I selected your class because I heard you were a good professor from my friend but I had no idea what I was in for. You've proven to me that not all professors are just out to get students and that some of them actually care about what they teach and want to make a difference in the world. You've made that difference and I hope that you keep doing what you do :).
Fantastic EngE 1216 instructor. Highest regards.
 Things  like  mothbidness  and  the  board  really  helped  to  keep  the  mood  up.  Also  I  appreciated  how  you  would  work/learn  with  us  and  always  had  a  good  outloook  and  sense  of  humor  about everything.
very good teacher
Dr. Gray is probably one of the most effective and caring professors I have ever had in my experience at VT. He made sure to check in with us every week asking both about our project status and our emotional status as COVID19 changed the way we learn. I recommend him by far to anyone taking ENGE courses.
I am really going to miss him because he made the class enjoyable.
He was an amazing instructor
The course was very interesting and enjoyable due to Dr. Gray's method of teaching and sense of humor.
Dr. Gray was one of if not my favorite professors this semester and I enjoyed the class and the drone project. I wish we could have completed them according to the original plan but that was out of everyone's control.
Really good teacher
