7 - 7A - Please add any comments about the physical environment here
It is a bit too far away for an 8AM that only freshmen take. A good 10-15 minute walk from one of the closest dorms. The department should reevaluate this but the classroom itself was very good and we were in range to hear.
It was a good learning environment.

It is such a lovely environment and feels like a fun meeting time!

I liked the classroom set up.
why would you put the freshman engineering class in the farthest building from the dorms
None
The class environment was tolerable.

I think I prefer the smaller class section in 1215 where I knew everyone. Felt like the entire class was part of a larger team in 1215.
Goodwin is so much nicer than Randolph
Larger class
Its far away
love the interaction with all activities
The instructor creates a very laid back environment.
Goodwin is a good building just far from the academic side.
We &lt;3 Goodwin
It was a good Classroom.
nothing
pretty rad
Would be nice if we were able to move around easier.
Even though the Goodwin room is really big it's nicer than being in Randolph.
Kinda crowded in class.
I don't like crossing campus to get to Goodwin Hall but it is my favorite building to learn in regardless.
Goodwin Hall is very nice!
Class size was a little too big
I learned more about hippos than I did engineering
I want to move the tables even though they are wired for power
Nice room
class size was large

Chairs and tables were quite cramped

Goodwin classrooms are not good for group work. Somewhat cramped space.
Very engaging and welcoming.
I like that the room/building is more modern than other rooms/buildings.
It was nice to have the tables with power strips
I've really enjoyed being in your class these past two semesters. I really appreciate you keeping it real with us. It was also very nice that you did the did the feedback activity earlier in the semester. It showed that you were willing to take criticism and learn from it. It set a very good example and I appreciated it very much.
The use of the microphone helped in hearing but sometimes the words on the slides were too small to see what they were.
I think its a good environment.
He tries to have the class interact with each other and with him during lecture. Overall the classroom has a great atmosphere.
Good
Overall a great environment. The mic worked great and the classroom was a good environment.
It was fine.
NA
It was a great learning environment.
I love Goodwin but it was not conducive to this sort of class. Having twelve different groups in the class was overwhelming six would have been plenty for a classroom but because of it it did not allow for that personal connection and nature to be built with the professor or the other students.
None of us even noticed the class size doubled from 1215.
The classroom was very nice and it was very easy to hear him talk with the mic he used.
N/A
Alot of people but not too crowded.
Liked it
I enjoyed the 70 student class format. Made for more in-depth conversations and a wider set of views.
This room is so much better than the room in Randolph last semester. However Goodwin is a hike from Lee Hall.
Good
One of the projectors was fluky but other than that it was fine.
It was fine.
Only class with light music in the background
The environment fostered mutual learning. Dr. Gray made the classroom a friendly environment.
N/A
People sometimes talk instead of whisper and its distracting
A lot better than randolph
I was in the front so it was probably easier for me to hear than people in the back tho im not sure.
I thought the classroom layout and props allowed me to work comfortably.
The environment feels condensed at times.
Goodwin is really nice I enjoyed it.
The bigger classroom was okay because of the groups we were split up into.
It was a traditional classroom environment.
none
There are far too many tables in that size room. It was hard and/or hazardous to walk around.
I like Goodwin. Too bad it's a mile away from my dorm.
Goodwin is perfect for study.
Some of the lectures were a but boring and the way he delivers his lectures can make that even boring. He has a very monotone voice which can make it hard to concentrate. But overall it was very good.
It's a very nice classroom. Having outlets in the desk is very helpful-- there was only one class I didn't have my charger when I needed it whereas I would have been in trouble several times without those outlets.
The Reverent Dr. Gray created a great environment for students to learn about engineering and encouraged students to continue on their way to what they want to do later on down the road. I also loved learning about Dr. Gray's work and his experience in the industry. I think more instructor should model their class after him.
The Goodwin classroom was comfortable and had plentiful outlets by far my favorite classroom this semester
Spicy
I really enjoy the long tables all facing the instructor.
The environment is good.
Great environment very relaxed and anyone is able to talk and ask questions.
The table power outlets suck. Seriously they didn't work the entire semester. plugs just fall out of the outlets and you have to physically hold them in to work.
During individual/group work he would play a music from a playlist made by us which was nice.
Good and comfortable classroom that made it easy to hear whoever was speaking and to see the board.
The environment was okay not outstanding but comfortable.
Dr. Gray created a great environment of learning and entertainment
No additional comments.
I liked the way the seating was arranged.
I want to move the tables but they are rooted for power. This had a significant affect on my learning ability.
I liked it.
The room in Goodwin was in great condition (far better than Randolph) and even sitting in the back I was able to hear was being said and feel engaged in each lesson.
Everyone was friendly.
This classroom was well geared toward the class.
good
Great classroom.
Having the class is Goodwin is a lot better than in Randolph.
very fun and inviting
The microphone was always on the desks were pretty spaced out and I liked how it was in Goodwin.
pretty solid Goodwin is really nice
Wish we could change tables to make groups. This would allow for easier group work.
None
I would like a more group fueled enviorment
the table layout made it hard for group communications but it was a good learning enviornment
it is good for the classroom
I felt like sometimes the class was a bit too big.
The classrooms at Goodwin Hall are very nice.
Room was spacious and the groups were able to communicate effectively. There could be speakers added as sometimes the mic was not audible.
N/A
no.
Good environment and fostered a good learning atmosphere.

Prefect environment I just have a short attention span.
Sometimes it was really warm and I was tired and fell asleep...not anyones fault tho
Great music that fosters learning overall great class environment.
It is nice just a long walk.
Would of been better if the class was better organized for group work.
Should be in an environment with tables conducive to group work
Just wish we didn't have to walk from literally one end of campus to the other for class.
Very nice room. Good acoustics.
The tables did not lend themselves well to group projects as they could not be moved and this made in-class assignments difficult.
It was usually happy and upbeat. People liked coming to class.
