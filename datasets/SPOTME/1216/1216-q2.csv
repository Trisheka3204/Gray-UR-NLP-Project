4 - 4A - What could you have done to be a better learner
I could've paid more attention to assignments during the first three weeks. I missed a few assignments which hurt my grade during the first half of the semester.
We could work on real designs for the drone several weeks earlier. I also think I could have spent more time on material choice.
Not sure
Go to class more
Focused on the assignments more. I could have listened to some of the lectures but was so tired that I sometimes fell asleep.
Not skipped class those two times to sleep in
N/A
I believe with the instructor's help I was able to put in my hundred percent into the class.
devoted more time to the course.
Done my work well ahead of time instead of the last minute.
I could have gone to office hours more often to get help on areas where I really struggled.
Took more notes.
I could have actively learned MATLAB on my own better.
I could have payed attention more. Some of the topics could be very boring specifically when we were going over MATLAB code or discussing the math equations for the drone project.
As a computer science major I felt like this class was a waste of time. While we did code in MATLAB it was not comprehensive whatsoever. MATLAB is not really used in the Computer Science industry either which made me question how helpful it really was to be learning it. The drone project was fun but I am not going to use any of the skills I learned from that project (i.e. everything in the Frith Lab and Solidworks).
I should have been a bit more organized with the class material.
Shown up to class.
Been more attentive.
Worked with the instructor earlier regarding issues with programs
Be more proactive and take more advantage of office hours when available.
I could have paid attention more in class
I should have practiced solidworks and MATLAB more
I think I should have gone above and beyond more often. After completing an assignment I felt like I didn't need to go above and beyond and I simply just submitted the assignment. I could have learned much more by doing my own research to go above and beyond.
Not a whole lot maybe not miss as many classes
Attended class more often
Be a better leader
nothing knew it most
Go to bed earlier so I am not as sleepy in class
I think being more actively attentive during class could've helped.

Not do homework for other classes during class.
Been more involved in the in class activities and lectures.
Taken more time to learn about coding.

alized how pointless the projects were so I did the bare minimum to get the grade I wanted. I doubt any action on my part would actually have led me to learn more since none of this class was geared towards learning.
Attended class more
Not fall asleep in class as much.
NA
Im not sure. Maybe go to office hours for MATLAB help but other than that everything was fine.
I could have done the assignments earlier and not waited until the day before or the day of for the majority of the assignments.
Went to every class lol
I could've been more attentive to the &#34;engineeringness&#34;
nothing
dove into the information more.
It would have been helpful to get personalized comments on assignments and not just a filled out rubric. Even only a few words such as &#34;Good job&#34; or asking a question to foster deeper thinking would be nice.
seen it as more of a learning experience rather than just assignments to get done.
I could have asked more questions and gone to office hours more.
Worked ahead
