Doc. Rev. Gray tried to be as accommodating as possible: if we pitched an idea he would try his best to let us take a crack at it. I appreciate his efforts to be flexible with us.
Your engineeringness and hippobidness kept me awake during an 8am. This is the one class I actually like. I think our physical projects were the most useful.
He kept the slides interesting. Normally I unintentionally nap during morning classes but he keeps the class fun. Furthermore the slides are easy to follow and I feel that I am able to absorb information out of that class a lot better than any other. Some of my other classes the teachers seem very tired and some do not engage with the students. But Dr. Rev. Gray seems happy and engaging.

Provide outside context
I really liked his Engineeringness presentations at the end of class. It reminded me every class that these seemingly tedious and difficult abstract problems we were struggling with actually lead up to something that can help us make a difference in the world. I know that the course requirements were vague and it's difficult to teach a ton of kids how to build functional planes when the vast majority of us have no practical aero knowledge however he did the best that he could by explaining stuff in office hours putting helpful documents and links on Canvas and most importantly listening to our concerns and making adaptations to his teaching performance to better accommodate our wants and needs.

 David  Gray  is  new  I  know  this.  As  a  class  we  voiced  many  concerns  over  inconsistent/unfair  grading  policies  and  ineffective  teaching  methods.  Most  of  our  qualms  were  with  the  ENGE department as a whole so his hands were tied.

Dr. Gray uses this as a jumping board to cater the curriculum around the class and giving us some level of agency over what we cover. This level of mutual respect is effective in keeping the class engaged with and excited about the material.
He made sure he talked with every single group and individual one-on-one to improve clarity and answer any questions.
The Reverent Dr. David Gray is one of the best if not the best instructor I've had at Virginia Tech. Every single class was unique and enjoyable to go to.

answered my questions
teaching
Dr. Gray went above and beyond more so than any other Professor/instructor I've ever had.

The detailed assignment descriptions were helpful especially during the online portion of this class. It was nice to have a clear expectation for every assignment.
Dr. Gray provided practical applications to nearly everything that we learned. For example during our ethics unit he tied the concepts to the very relevant Boeing 737 MAX crashes which made the lectures much more interesting. I also deeply appreciated how much effort he put in to making the class enjoyable and free of busy work. He seemed to truly care about his students.
He added a dash of fun with the moth facts that made the class worth looking forward too.
Regular communication and fun and positive learning
He was available during the entirety of the class to ask questions
Gave thorough lectures and made sure everyone had a chance to ask questions if they did not understand.
He made the material engaging with his entertaining teaching style and effectively communicated the important things that we needed to learn in the class. Also he is one of the professors that I feel  still  very  engaged  with  even  after  this  whole  covid  situation  started  with  weekly  updates  along  with  the  normal  class  lectures  and  optional  meetings  with  supplemental  learning  and communication between him and students.
Cared about students
